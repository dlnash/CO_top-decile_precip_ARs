	abstract = {Hydrologic modeling and other geophysical applications are sensitive to precipitation forcing data quality, and there are known challenges in spatially distributing gauge-based precipitation over complex terrain. We conduct a comparison of six high-resolution, daily and monthly gridded precipitation datasets over the Western United States. We compare the long-term average spatial patterns, and interannual variability of water-year total precipitation, as well as multi-year trends in precipitation across the datasets. We find that the greatest absolute differences among datasets occur in high-elevation areas and in the maritime mountain ranges of the Western United States, while the greatest percent differences among datasets relative to annual total precipitation occur in arid and rain-shadowed areas. Differences between datasets in some high-elevation areas exceed 200mmyr−1 on average, and relative differences range from 5 to 60\% across the Western United States. In areas of high topographic relief, true uncertainties and biases are likely higher than the differences among the datasets; we present evidence of this based on streamflow observations. Precipitation trends in the datasets differ in magnitude and sign at smaller scales, and are sensitive to how temporal inhomogeneities in the underlying precipitation gauge data are handled.},

	abstract = {Since drought and excessive rainfall can have significant socioeconomic impacts, it is important to have accurate high-resolution gridded datasets that can help improve analysis and forecasting of these conditions. One such widely used dataset is the Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). PRISM uses a digital elevation model (DEM) to obtain gridded elevation analyses and then uses a regression analysis along with approximately 15 000 surface precipitation measurements to produce a 4-km resolution daily precipitation product over the conterminous United States. The U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) consists of 114 stations that take highly accurate meteorological measurements across all regions of the United States. A comparison between the USCRN and PRISM was performed using data from 2006 to 2018. There were good comparisons between the two datasets across nearly all seasons and regions; most mean daily differences were {\textless}1 mm, with most absolute daily differences {\textasciitilde}5 mm. The most general characteristics were for a net dry bias in the PRISM data in the Southwest and a net moist bias in the southern United States. Verifying the PRISM dataset provides us with confidence it can be used with estimates of evapotranspiration, high-resolution gridded soil properties, and vegetation datasets to produce a daily gridded soil moisture product for operational use in the analyses and prediction of drought and excessive soil moisture conditions.},

	abstract = {This study presents (1) the temporal variations and trends of monthly and daily temperature and precipitation extremes in Alaska, and (2) the synoptic-scale circulation patterns associated with these extremes. The analysis is based on daily station observations of maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation from 1948–2012 as well as monthly average temperatures and precipitation from 1920–2012 from 13 Alaska climate divisions. The frequencies of daily and monthly temperature extremes show variability and trends over the past 50–90 years consistent with a warming climate in Alaska. This warming is superimposed on low-frequency variability attributed to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Unlike the temperature extremes, occurrences of heavy-precipitation extremes do not display a coherent signal through time. The changes do not appear to be linked with an overall increase in the variance of temperature or precipitation. Composite analysis of sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies associated with a representative sample of different daily and monthly temperature extremes across Alaska shows that temperature and moisture advection, subject to topographic and coastal influences, is a key driver of these events. Composite SLP fields for daily and monthly extremes are similar, especially in winter, indicating that monthly extremes represent the recurrence of daily extreme patterns during those extreme months. The SLP anomalies were also often reduced in magnitude in the summer events compared with winter, consistent with the lower variance of temperature and SLP during summer.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow regions of intense water vapour transport in the Earth’s atmosphere. These transient phenomena carry water from the subtropics to the mid-latitudes and polar regions1,2, making up the majority of polewards moisture transport3–5 and exerting control on the precipitation and water resources in many regions6,7. In addition to transporting moisture, ARs also transport heat, but the impact of this transport on global near-surface air temperatures has not yet been characterized. Here we show that seasons with more frequent ARs also have warmer than average temperatures in many mid-latitude regions, and that AR events are associated with temperature anomalies of 5–10 °C above the climatological mean. This is due to anomalous horizontal transport and convergence of sensible heat and moisture in the lower atmosphere, which increases both downward sensible heat flux and downwelling long-wave radiation at the surface. On an hourly timescale, over 70\% of extreme warm-temperature anomalies occur within ARs in large portions of the mid-latitudes, and ARs are associated with moist and compound heatwaves in many regions worldwide, suggesting that consideration of ARs may improve predictive capability for certain extreme heat events. Our results demonstrate that ARs significantly impact air temperatures on a wide array of timescales, and that they may play a wider role in global energy transport than previously recognized.},

	abstract = {The California Landfalling Jets Experiment (CALJET) was carried out during the winter of 1997/98, in part to study orographic rainfall in California's coastal mountains using coastal wind profilers. This observational study statistically links hourly rainfall rates observed by tipping-bucket rain gauges in California's quasi-linear coastal mountains to the hourly averaged upslope component of the flow measured by coastal wind profilers immediately upstream. Vertical profiles of the linear correlation coefficient of upslope flow versus rain rate are calculated on a case-by-case basis, for all cases containing a low-level jet (LLJ), and for the winter season of 1997/98. These correlation coefficient profiles show a direct relationship between the magnitude of the upslope flow impacting the coast and the magnitude of the rain rate in the downstream coastal mountains. Maximum correlation coefficients are as large as 0.94 in some individual cases, 0.75 for a composite of LLJ cases, and 0.70 for the winter season. Using three locations with differing coastal terrain characteristics, it is found that the layer of upslope flow that optimally modulates orographic rainfall is near mountaintop, that is, about 1 km above mean sea level for California's coastal ranges. This height also corresponds to the mean altitude of landfalling LLJs observed by the coastal profilers. The correlation coefficient in this layer is largest when the rain rates are used from the coastal mountain sites rather than from the coastal sites, thus further highlighting the physical connection between upslope flow and orographic rainfall in the coastal mountains. The presence of shallow, terrain-blocked flow modulates the correlation coefficient profiles below mountaintop, such that the low-level flow at the coast is poorly correlated with rain rates observed in the coastal mountains. However, cases without significant blocking retain relatively large correlation coefficient values below mountaintop. Landfalling LLJs produce the largest enhancement of upslope flow at the altitude of the LLJ, despite the existence of terrain-modified flows below mountaintop during some LLJ events. The steepest increase in rain rate for a given increase in upslope flow also occurs at jet level, as does the largest correlation coefficient of upslope flow versus rain rate. Therefore, the upslope-induced orographic rain-rate response associated with landfalling LLJs is largest (2.55 mm h−1) and statistically most robust near the altitude of those LLJs.},

However, the contribution of temporal compounding to AR-induced loss has yet to be systematically quantified. We show that the strongest ARs are more likely to be part of sequences, which are periods of elevated hydrologic hazard associated with temporally clustered ARs. Sequences increase the likelihood of flood-related impacts by 8.3\% on AR days and 5.4\% on non-AR days, and across two independent loss datasets, we find that ARs within sequences have over three times higher expected losses compared to ARs outside of sequences. Expected losses also increase when the preceding AR is higher intensity, when time since the preceding AR is shorter, and when an AR is the second or later event within a sequence. We conclude that temporal compounding is a critical source of information for predicting an AR’s potential consequences.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the intensity of the precipitation ARs often bring, and their unique combinations of durations, geometries, winds, and temperatures which make ARs important and unique pieces of the climatology and landscapes that affect both natural systems and human societies. Mountains profoundly affect AR conditions and processes, for instance, especially because ARs transport vast quantities of water vapor, which can result in huge amounts of precipitation. These vast quantities pose risks (flooding) and provide benefits (water resources) as well as affect aquatic ecosystems, terrestrial landscapes, surface winds, and coastal sea levels. Section 5.5 reviews the distinct regional patterns of AR effects across North America, Europe, South America, New Zealand, and the Arctic and Antarctica. Section 5.6 summarizes the key meteorological and land characteristics of ARs that most strongly determine the consequences of their landfalls and inland penetrations. Improvements in forecasting AR storms and conditions offer significant opportunities for improved ecosystem, resource, and disaster management across all sorts of landscapes and societal needs. But because ARs have their own physical and statistical properties relative to other storms and weather phenomena, recognition of their special roles in these systems will allow more targeted responses to both the risks and benefits of ARs.},

During this period, a record-setting system produced severe convection, high winds, and heavy rain and snow on 21–22 January. The severe weather included tornadoes in California and gusts in excess of 40 m s−1 associated with an intense squall line affecting southeast California and Arizona. One of the primary impacts of the storms was a heavy precipitation event across Arizona. Rainfall amounts of 125–250 mm were recorded along the Mogollon Rim in central Arizona, while higher elevations in northern Arizona received 100–150 cm of snow, with one site setting the state's 24-h snowfall record. The heavy snow and high winds resulted in widespread power outages and paralyzed travel across portions of northern Arizona. All-time minimum pressure records were set across a large portion of the western United States from Oregon to Arizona. This was an extraordinary event that was well predicted. Standardized anomalies derived from the GFS Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) indicated a potentially historic storm one week in advance. The forecast synoptic-scale anomalies were well correlated with high-impact weather across the western United States. This case demonstrates the utility of using standardized anomalies to increase situational awareness, which enables operational forecasters to provide decision makers with information regarding the potential significance of pending weather events. The event will also be utilized to demonstrate an anomaly-based situational awareness display for streamlining the identification, and analysis, of significant forecast anomalies.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs) can cause flooding when they are strong and stall over an already wet watershed. While earlier studies emphasized the role of individual, long-duration ARs in triggering floods, it is not uncommon for floods to be associated with a series of ARs that strike in close succession. This study uses measurements from an atmospheric river observatory at Bodega Bay (BBY), in Northern California, to identify periods when multiple AR events occurred in rapid succession. Here, an AR “event” is the period when AR conditions are present continuously at BBY. An objective method is developed to identify such periods, and the concept of “AR families” is introduced. During the period studied there were 228 AR events. Using the AR family identification method, a range of aggregation periods (the length of time allowed for ARs to be considered part of a family) was tested. For example, for an aggregation period of 5 days, there were 109 AR families, with an average of 2.7 ARs per family. Over a range of possible aggregation periods, typically there were 2–6 ARs per family. Compared to single AR events, the synoptic environment of AR families is characterized by lower geopotential heights throughout the midlatitude North Pacific, an enhanced subtropical high, and a stronger zonal North Pacific jet. Analysis of water year 2017 demonstrated a persistent geopotential height dipole throughout the North Pacific and a positive anomaly of integrated water vapor extending toward California. AR families were favored when synoptic features were semistationary.},

We consider the AR—a one-in-500-year event—as the trigger for the devastating Beach Road Landslide (BRLS), which destroyed or damaged four residences and took the lives of two people. The BRLS started as a debris avalanche and transitioned into a debris flow, with a total approximate landslide volume of 187,100 m3. Geomorphic analysis using lidar data identified evidence of paleo-landslides and displaced masses of rock, one of which served as the source area for the BRLS. Significant structural features in the weak ultramafic bedrock defined the head scarp area and formed the failure plane. This study illustrates the importance of identifying pre-existing landslide features and source areas likely to produce future landslides. As an increase in ROS events is projected for Southeast Alaska with warmer and wetter winters, we recommend the development of an AR scale coupled with geological information for the region, to enhance warnings to residents in landslide-prone areas.},

	abstract = {©2018. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow, long, transient, water vapor-rich corridors of the atmosphere that are responsible for over 90\% of the poleward water vapor transport in and across midlatitudes. However, the role of ARs in modulating extratropical and polar hydroclimate features (e.g., water vapor content and precipitation) has not been fully studied, even though moistening of the polar atmosphere is both a key result and amplifier of Arctic warming and sea ice melt, and precipitation is key to the surface mass balance of polar sea ice and ice sheets. This study uses the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 reanalysis to characterize the roles of AR water vapor transport on the column-integrated atmospheric water vapor budget in the extratropical and polar regions of both hemispheres. Meridional water vapor transport by ARs across a given latitude (examined for 40°, 50°, 60°, and 70°) is strongly related to variations in area-averaged (i.e., over the cap poleward of the given latitude) total water vapor storage and precipitation poleward of that latitude. For the climatological annual cycle, both AR transport (i.e., nonlocal sources) and total evaporation (i.e., local sources) are most correlated with total precipitation, although with slightly different phases. However, for monthly anomalies, the water budget at higher latitudes is largely dominated by the relationship between AR transport and precipitation. For pentad and daily anomalies, AR transport is related to both precipitation and water vapor storage variations. These results demonstrate the important role of episodic, extreme water vapor transports by ARs in modulating extratropical and polar hydroclimate.},

AR conditions were present during or preceding 105 unique avalanche incidents resulting in 123 fatalities, thus comprising 31\% of western U.S. avalanche fatalities. Coastal snow avalanche climates had the highest percentage of avalanche fatalities coinciding with AR conditions (31\%-65\%), followed by intermountain (25\%-46\%) and continental snow avalanche climates ({\textless} 25\%). Ratios of avalanche deaths during AR conditions to total AR days increased with distance from the coast. Frequent heavy to extreme precipitation (85th-99th percentile) during ARs favored critical snowpack loading rates with mean snow water equivalent increases of 46 mm. Results demonstrate that there exists regional consistency between snow avalanche climates, derived AR contributions to cool season precipitation, and percentages of avalanche fatalities during ARs. The intensity of water vapor transport and topographic corridors favoring inland water vapor transport may be used to help identify periods of increased avalanche hazard in intermountain and continental snow avalanche climates prior to AR landfall.

This paper introduces a scale for the intensity and impacts of ARs. Its utility may be greatest where ARs are the most impactful storm type and hurricanes, nor’easters, and tornadoes are nearly nonexistent. Two parameters dominate the hydrologic outcomes and impacts of ARs: vertically integrated water vapor transport (IVT) and AR duration [i.e., the duration of at least minimal AR conditions (IVT ≥ 250 kg m–1 s–1)]. The scale uses an observed or predicted time series of IVT at a given geographic location and is based on the maximum IVT and AR duration at that point during an AR event. AR categories 1–5 are defined by thresholds for maximum IVT (3-h average) of 250, 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 kg m–1 s–1, and by IVT exceeding 250 kg m–1 s–1 continuously for 24–48 h.

This is governed by seasonally dependent pattern changes in the North Atlantic subtropical high (NASH), that are further linked to the poleward shift of the North America westerly jet (NAWJ). In spring and autumn, a substantial poleward NAWJ shift drives anomalous surface high poleward of the NASH and enhances the southerly GPLLJ to its west over the Central US. Among models, the NASH expansion and GPLLJ enhancement are correlated with the poleward NAWJ shift. In summer, the poleward NAWJ shift is weak and acts more northward.

Following three years of drought from 2020 to 2022, intense landfalling ARs across California in December 2022–January 2023 were responsible for bringing reservoirs back to historical averages and producing damaging floods and debris flows. In recent years, the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes and collaborating institu-; tions have developed and routinely provided to end users peer-reviewed experimental seasonal (1–6 month lead time) and subseasonal (2–6 week lead time) prediction tools for western U.S. ARs, circulation regimes, and precipitation. Here, we evaluate the performance of experimental seasonal precipitation forecasts for winter 2022/23, along with experimental subseasonal AR activity and circulation forecasts during the December 2022 regime shift from dry conditions to persistent troughing and record AR-driven wetness over the western United States. Experimental seasonal precipitation forecasts were too dry across Southern California (likely due to their over-reliance on La Niña), and the observed above-normal precipitation across Northern and Central California was underpredicted. However, experimental subseasonal forecasts skillfully captured the regime shift from dry to wet conditions in late December 2022 at 2–3 week lead time. During this time, an active MJO shift from phases 4 and 5 to 6 and 7 occurred, which historically tilts the odds toward increased AR activity over California. New experimental seasonal and subseasonal synthesis forecast products, designed to aggregate information across institutions and methods, are introduced in the context of this historic winter to provide situational awareness guidance to western U.S. water managers.},

	abstract = {In March 2019, a strong atmospheric river (AR) originating from the Gulf of Mexico transported abundant moisture inland and fueled a record-breaking bomb cyclone in Colorado, resulting in widespread winter weather hazards across several states. Experimental model simulations and trajectory analysis indicate that mid-tropospheric latent heat release (LHR) coincided with the strength of the warm conveyor belt and played a key role in the deepening of the cyclone. The LHR promoted the generation of a lower tropospheric positive potential vorticity (PV) anomaly and a stronger low-level cyclonic circulation, enhancing the cyclone, low-level jet stream, and associated water vapor transport. Additionally, it generated an upper tropospheric negative PV anomaly and strong upper-level anticyclonic circulation, influencing the structure of the trough-ridge couplet and the associated Rossby wave. Reductions in the initial intensity of the AR and disallowing LHR both weakened the cyclone. However, disallowing LHR significantly disturbed the synoptic-scale structure of the storm and embedded Rossby wave, resulting in a stronger impact. Thus, the reduction of diabatic PV generation, under the influence of AR activities, was crucial in the explosive intensification of the cyclone. Additionally, the reductions in AR intensity and the magnitude of cyclone weakening did not show a linear relationship. Few studies have explored interactions between ARs and continental cyclones, and this paper highlights the need for further research on AR-associated extreme weather events inland.},

This study investigates this relationship among land-falling ARs, IVT, and watershed mean areal precipitation (MAP) for a 38-yr period over California. On average, the daily average IVT magnitude at different coastal locations explains ∼34\% of the variance in annual watershed MAP across 140 Hydrologic Unit Code 8 (HUC-8) watersheds with large spatial variability across California. Further investigation of the IVT magnitude and direction at coastal locations illustrated that accounting for water vapor transport direction increases the explained variance in annual MAP to an average of 45\%, with highest values (∼65\%) occurring in watersheds over Northern and coastal California. Similar investigation of the lower-tropospheric water vapor flux vector at 850 and 925 hPa revealed further increases in the explained variance in annual MAP to an average of {\textgreater}50\%. The results of this study 1) emphasize the importance of both IVT direction and water vapor flux altitude to watershed MAP, 2) align well with previous studies for select locations that highlight the importance of upslope (i.e., lower tropospheric) water vapor flux during landfalling ARs and precipitation, and 3) motivate the development of AR-related and watershed-centric forecast tools that incorporate IVT direction and water vapor flux altitude parameters in addition to IVT magnitude.},

On average, total water vapor transport (TIVT) in an AR was 4.7 × 108 ± 2 × 108 kg s−1. This magnitude is 2.6 times larger than the average discharge of liquid water from the Amazon River. The mean AR width was 890 ± 270 km. Subtropical ARs contained larger integrated water vapor (IWV) but weaker winds than midlatitude ARs, although average TIVTs were nearly the same. Mean TIVTs calculated by defining the lateral “edges” of ARs using an IVT threshold versus an IWV threshold produced results that differed by less than 10\% across all cases, but did vary between the midlatitudes and subtropical regions.},

Building on previous versions of tARget, this paper discusses further refinements to the algorithm to better handle ARs in tropical and polar areas, as well as “zonal” ARs which the previous versions of the algorithm were not designed to capture. This further regionally refined algorithm is applied to the ERA5 reanalysis over 1940–2023 at 6 h intervals and a 0.25° × 0.25° horizontal resolution.

	title = {Invited {Perspectives}: {Integrating} hydrologic information into the next generation of landslide early warning systems},
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. Although rainfall-triggered landslides are initiated by subsurface hydro-mechanical processes related to the loading, weakening, and eventual failure of slope materials, most landslide early warning systems (LEWS) have relied solely on rainfall event information. In previous decades, several studies demonstrated the value of integrating proxies for subsurface hydrologic information to improve rainfall-based forecasting of shallow landslides. More recently, broader access to commercial sensors and telemetry for real-time data transmission has invigorated new research into hydrometeorological thresholds for LEWS. Given the increasing number of studies across the globe using hydrologic monitoring, mathematical modeling, or both in combination, it is now possible to make some insights into the advantages versus limitations of this approach. The extensive progress demonstrates the value of in situ hydrologic information for reducing both failed and false alarms, through the ability to characterize infiltration during, as well as the drainage and drying processes between major storm events. There are also some areas for caution surrounding the long-term sustainability of subsurface monitoring in landslide-prone terrain, as well as unresolved questions in hillslope hydrologic modeling, which relies heavily on the assumptions of diffuse flow and vertical infiltration but often ignores preferential flow and lateral drainage. Here, we share a collective perspective based on our previous collaborative work across Europe, North America, Africa, and Asia to discuss these challenges and provide some guidelines for integrating knowledge of hydrology and climate into the next generation of LEWS. We propose that the greatest opportunity for improvement is through a measure-and-model approach to develop an understanding of landslide hydro-climatology that accounts for local controls on subsurface storage dynamics. Additionally, new efforts focused on the subsurface hydrology are complementary to existing rainfall-based methods, so leveraging these with near-term precipitation forecasts is also a priority for increasing lead times.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This study presents the variability and trends of landfalling ARs (LARs) along the higher (53.5°–60.0°N) and lower (47.0°–53.5°N) latitudes of British Columbia and southeastern Alaska (BCSAK) during the 1948–2016 period. Moreover, we present the synoptic evolution and distribution of LARs in BCSAK during different phases of ocean–atmosphere climate variability using a six-hourly AR catalogue from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and reanalysis data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research. During 1948–2016, BCSAK averages 35 ± 5 LARs annually, with the highest frequency during fall (13 ± 2) and lowest during spring (5 ± 2). The frequency of LARs across BCSAK rises during the study period, and the increase between 1979 and 2016 is statistically significant (p {\textless}.05). A strong ridge over the Pacific Northwest and BC and a trough over the Gulf of Alaska and the Northeastern Pacific Ocean favours AR landfalls at the higher and lower latitudes, respectively. BCSAK experiences greater numbers of LARs during neutral phases of El Niño/Southern Oscillation, the 2013/2014 Pacific oceanic blob, and during the positive phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Pacific North American Pattern.},

	abstract = {Debris flows pose persistent hazards and shape high-relief landscapes in diverse physiographic settings, but predicting the spatiotemporal occurrence of debris flows in postglacial topography remains challenging. To evaluate the debris flow process in high-relief postglacial terrain, we conducted a geomorphic investigation to characterize geologic, glacial, volcanic, and land use contributions to landslide initiation across Southeast Alaska. To evaluate controls on landslide (esp. debris flow) occurrence in Sitka, we used field observation, geomorphic mapping, landslide characteristics as documented in the Tongass National Forest inventory, and a novel application of the shallow landslide model SHALSTAB to postglacial terrain. A complex geomorphic history of glaciation and volcanic activity provides a template for spatially heterogeneous landslide occurrence. Landslide density across the region is highly variable, but debris flow density is high on south- or southeast-facing hillslopes where volcanic tephra soils are present and/or where timber harvest has occurred since 1900. High landslide density along the western coast of Baranof and Kruzof islands coincides with deposition of glacial sediment and thick tephra and exposure to extreme rainfall from atmospheric rivers on south-facing aspects but the relative contributions of these controls are unclear. Timber harvest has also been identified as an important control on landslide occurrence in the region. Focusing on a subset of geo-referenced landslides near Sitka, we used the SHALSTAB shallow landslide initiation model, which has been frequently applied in non-glacial terrain, to identify areas of high landslide potential in steep, convergent terrain. In a validation against mapped landslide polygons, the model significantly outperformed random guessing, with area under the curve (AUC) = 0.709 on a performance classification curve of true positives vs. false positives. This successful application of SHALSTAB demonstrates practical utility for hazards analysis in postglacial landscapes to mitigate risk to people and infrastructure.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are characterized by intense moisture transport, which, on landfall, produce precipitation which can be both beneficial and destructive. ARs in California, for example, are known to have ended drought conditions but also to have caused substantial socio-economic damage from landslides and flooding linked to extreme precipitation. Understanding how AR characteristics will respond to a warming climate is, therefore, vital to the resilience of communities affected by them, such as the western USA, Europe, East Asia and South Africa. In this Review, we use a theoretical framework to synthesize understanding of the dynamic and thermodynamic responses of ARs to anthropogenic warming and connect them to observed and projected changes and impacts revealed by observations and complex models. Evidence suggests that increased atmospheric moisture (governed by Clausius–Clapeyron scaling) will enhance the intensity of AR-related precipitation — and related hydrological extremes — but with changes that are ultimately linked to topographic barriers. However, due to their dependency on both weather and climate-scale processes, which themselves are often poorly constrained, projections are uncertain. To build confidence and improve resilience, future work must focus efforts on characterizing the multiscale development of ARs and in obtaining observations from understudied regions, including the West Pacific, South Pacific and South Atlantic. Due to their intense moisture transport, atmospheric rivers are associated with hydrological hazards such as extreme rainfall and flooding. This Review discusses how atmospheric-river characteristics and impacts may change with warming, synthesizing physical theory, observations and modelling.},

Here we employ topographic differencing, utilizing repeat aerial lidar, to quantify net sediment transport volumes in 120 of these mass movements within an area of 102 km2 west of Boulder, Colorado. Comparing our results against published long-term erosion rates, we find that these mass movements evacuated the equivalent of hundreds to thousands of years of hillslope weathering products. We conclude that (1) rare debris flows perform the majority of sediment transport and channel erosion within steep channels along the eastern edge of the Front Range, potentially explaining discrepancies between modern sediment yields and long-term erosion rates in such settings, and (2) the high spatial density of debris flows along the corridors bounding steep canyons suggests that the landscape switches to debris-flow dominance as knickpoints pass headward along the canyons.},

	abstract = {Although atmospheric rivers (ARs) typically weaken following landfall, those that penetrate inland can contribute to heavy precipitation and high-impact weather within the interior of western North America. In this paper, the authors examine the evolution of ARs over western North America using trajectories released at 950 and 700 hPa within cool-season ARs along the Pacific coast. These trajectories are classified as coastal decaying, inland penetrating, or interior penetrating based on whether they remain within an AR upon reaching selected transects over western North America. Interior-penetrating AR trajectories most frequently make landfall along the Oregon coast, but the greatest fraction of landfalling AR trajectories that eventually penetrate into the interior within an AR is found along the Baja Peninsula. In contrast, interior-penetrating AR trajectories rarely traverse the southern "high" Sierra. At landfall, interior-penetrating AR trajectories are associated with a more amplified flow pattern, more southwesterly (vs westerly) flow along the Pacific coast, and larger water vapor transport (qν). The larger initial qν of interior-penetrating AR trajectories is due primarily to larger initial water vapor q and wind speed ν for those initiated at 950 and 700 hPa, respectively. Inland- and interior-penetrating AR trajectories maintain large qν over the interior partially due to increases in ν that offset decreases in q, particularly in the vicinity of topographical barriers. Therefore, synoptic conditions and trajectory pathways favoring larger initial qν at the coast, limited water vapor depletion by orographic precipitation, and increases in ν over the interior are keys to differentiating interior-penetrating from coastal-decaying ARs.},

The term “snow drought” has recently emerged to describe periods of anomalously low snowpack. Unique seasonal patterns in precipitation and temperature that drive snow drought can have distinct hydrologic signatures, and these relationships have not been carefully studied in the UCRB.

An elevation‐based analysis reveals two distinct patterns: warm snow droughts see severe SWE reductions primarily at lower (\&lt;2600 m) elevations (65\% at lower elevations, 37\% overall), whereas “dry” scenarios exhibit a consistent reduction across all elevations (39\% overall). Using naturalized streamflow data, we also differentiate snow droughts by their earlier streamflow timing and decreased peakedness (warm: 7 days, 2\%; dry: 7 days, 2\%; warm \&amp; dry: 13 days, 5\%).

More frequent above-freezing temperatures lead a transition from snow- to rain-dominant precipitation regimes, accelerating glacial mass balance loss and a leading to a greater risk for warm-season drought. Southeast Alaska has steep topographical gradients, which necessitate the use of downscaled climate information to study historical and projected periods. This study used regional dynamical downscaling at 4-km spatial resolution with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model to assess historical (1981–2010) and projected (2031–60) climate states for southeast Alaska. These simulations were driven by one reanalysis (i.e., the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis) and two climate models (i.e., the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model, version 3, and the NCAR Community Climate System Model, version 4), which each included a historical simulation and a projected simulation. The future simulations used the representative concentration pathway 8.5 emissions scenario. Bias-corrected projections (2031–60 minus 1981–2010) indicated seasonal warming of 1°–3°C, increased precipitation during autumn (4\%–12\%) and winter (7\%–12\%), and decreased snowfall in all seasons (up to 60\% in autumn). The average number of days annually with a minimum temperature below freezing dropped by more than 30. The average annual maximum consecutive 3-day precipitation amounts increased by 11\%–16\%, but analogous extreme snowfall amounts dropped by 5\%–11\%. The most substantial snow losses occurred at low-elevation and coastal locations; at many high elevations (e.g., above 1000 m), extreme snowfall amounts increased.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A storm catalog of 66 rainfall events during the 9-year period has been developed. Climatological analyses of extreme rainfall are carried out both from an Eulerian perspective, in which distributional aspects of rainfall at fixed locations are examined, and from a Lagrangian perspective, in which distributional aspects of rainfall are based on storm-tracking algorithms. Of particular interest is the spatial heterogeneity of extreme rainfall in the complex terrain of the upper Arkansas River basin. Lagrangian analyses are used to characterize the spatially varying distribution of storm initiation, storm motion, and storm structure. Climatological analyses indicate that convective rainfall in the Arkansas River basin above Canon City (drainage area of 8070 km2) does not contribute to the extreme flood response of the Arkansas River at Pueblo (drainage area of 12,140 km2). There is pronounced diurnal variation in warm season rainfall in the Arkansas River basin, and this feature of extreme rainfall is a key element of flood response in the upper Arkansas River basin. Climatological analyses of extreme rainfall in the upper Arkansas River basin are examined relative to the spatial and temporal properties of rainfall for extreme flood events that have occurred in the basin, including major flood episodes in June 1921 and June 1965.},

	abstract = {Abstract A 69-station, densely spaced rain gauge network was maintained over the period 1951–1958 in the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, located in the southern Appalachians in western North Carolina, USA. This unique dataset was used to develop the first digital seasonal and annual precipitation maps for the Coweeta basin, using elevation regression functions and residual interpolation. It was found that a 10-m elevation grid filtered to an approximately 7-km effective wavelength explained the most variance in precipitation (R2 = 0.82–0.95). A ‘dump zone’ of locally high precipitation a short distance downwind from the mountain crest marking the southern border of the basin was the main feature that was not explained well by the precipitation–elevation relationship. These data and maps provided a rare ‘ground-truth’ for estimating uncertainty in the national-scale Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) precipitation grids for this location and time period. Differences between PRISM and ground-truth were compared with uncertainty estimates produced by the PRISM model and cross-validation errors. Potential sources of uncertainty in the national PRISM grids were evaluated, including the effects of coarse grid resolution, limited station data, and imprecise station locations. The PRISM national grids matched closely (within 5{\textbackslash}\%) with the Coweeta dataset. The PRISM regression prediction interval, which includes the influence of stations in an area of tens of kilometres around a given location, overestimated the local error at Coweeta (12–20{\textbackslash}\%). Offsetting biases and generally low error rates made it difficult to isolate major sources of uncertainty in the PRISM grids, but station density and selection, and mislocation of stations were identified as likely sources of error. The methods used in this study can be repeated in other areas where high-density data exist to gain a more comprehensive picture of the uncertainties in national-level datasets, and can be used in network optimization exercises.},

	abstract = {Abstract Spatial climate data sets of 1971?2000 mean monthly precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature were developed for the conterminous United States. These 30-arcsec (?800-m) grids are the official spatial climate data sets of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) interpolation method was used to develop data sets that reflected, as closely as possible, the current state of knowledge of spatial climate patterns in the United States. PRISM calculates a climate?elevation regression for each digital elevation model (DEM) grid cell, and stations entering the regression are assigned weights based primarily on the physiographic similarity of the station to the grid cell. Factors considered are location, elevation, coastal proximity, topographic facet orientation, vertical atmospheric layer, topographic position, and orographic effectiveness of the terrain. Surface stations used in the analysis numbered nearly 13 000 for precipitation and 10 000 for temperature. Station data were spatially quality controlled, and short-period-of-record averages adjusted to better reflect the 1971?2000 period. PRISM interpolation uncertainties were estimated with cross-validation (C-V) mean absolute error (MAE) and the 70\% prediction interval of the climate?elevation regression function. The two measures were not well correlated at the point level, but were similar when averaged over large regions. The PRISM data set was compared with the WorldClim and Daymet spatial climate data sets. The comparison demonstrated that using a relatively dense station data set and the physiographically sensitive PRISM interpolation process resulted in substantially improved climate grids over those of WorldClim and Daymet. The improvement varied, however, depending on the complexity of the region. Mountainous and coastal areas of the western United States, characterized by sparse data coverage, large elevation gradients, rain shadows, inversions, cold air drainage, and coastal effects, showed the greatest improvement. The PRISM data set benefited from a peer review procedure that incorporated local knowledge and data into the development process. Copyright ? 2008 Royal Meteorological Society},

MetPy strives to employ best practices in its development, including software tests, continuous integration, and automated publishing of web-based documentation. As such, MetPy represents a sustainable, long-term project that fills a need for the meteorological community. MetPy’s development is substantially driven by its user community, both through feedback on a variety of open, public forums like Stack Overflow, and through code contributions facilitated by the GitHub collaborative software development platform. MetPy has recently seen the release of version 1.0, with robust functionality for analyzing and visualizing meteorological datasets. While previous versions of MetPy have already seen extensive use, the 1.0 release represents a significant milestone in terms of completeness and a commitment to long-term support for the programming interfaces. This article provides an overview of MetPy’s suite of capabilities, including its use of labeled arrays and physical unit information as its core data model, unit-aware calculations, cross sections, skew T and GEMPAK-like plotting, station model plots, and support for parsing a variety of meteorological data formats.

Six locations were selected—Cedar City (Utah), Grand Junction (Colorado), Eastonville (Colorado), Laveen (Arizona), Redrock (New Mexico), and Melrose (New Mexico)—together, they represent six spatial regions of summer precipitation for the Southwest. Moisture tracks were generated for all the rainy days at these stations for the historical period 1979–2013. Tracks were generated for a 3-day period ending with the day of rainfall, which were then used to identify the source of moisture, pathway or trajectory, and the modulation along the track. The four major sources of moisture—Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico (GoM), land, and the Pacific Ocean—were identified as responsible for summer rainfall over southwestern United States. The two dominant moisture sources at Laveen, Cedar City, Redrock, Grand Junction, and Eastonville were Gulf of California and land; at Melrose GoM and land were the dominant sources. The leading source of moisture at each location contributed to most of the extreme rainfall events. Tracks from GoM traveled the fastest and those from land sources were the slowest. Large-scale circulation features–pressure, convergence, and specific humidity–were consistent with the moisture tracks and were found to be strong throughout the 3-day period. This detailed and comprehensive generation of rainfall tracks offers unique insights into the moisture source and delivery for summer rainfall over southwestern United States.},

	abstract = {Abstract Narrow cold-frontal rain bands (NCFR) often produce short-duration and high-intensity precipitation that can lead to flooding and debris flow in California (CA). On 27 January 2021, an atmospheric river (AR) associated with an intense surface cyclone made landfall over coastal northern CA, which featured a prominent NCFR. This study uses high-resolution West Weather Research and Forecasting simulations to accurately resolve the gap and core structure of the NCFR and provide reliable precipitation estimations, compensating for limitations of radar and satellite observations. This NCFR was supported by robust synoptic-scale quasi-geostrophic (QG) forcing for ascent and frontogenesis. It propagated southward from Cape Mendocino to Big Sur in 12 hr before stalling and rotating counter-clockwise in central/southern CA due to upstream Rossby wave breaking and an amplifying upper-tropospheric trough. With the lower to middle tropospheric flow backed considerably to the south-southwest over the NCFR, the increase of the vertical wind shear caused the transition from parallel to trailing stratiform precipitation. The stall and pivot of the AR and NCFR led to intense rainfall with a 2-day precipitation accumulation greater than 300 mm over central CA. In addition, under the potential instability and frontogenesis, a moist absolutely unstable layer between 850 and 700 hPa was captured at the leading edge of the NCFR, which indicated slantwise deep layer lifting and high precipitation efficiency. This study reveals synoptic-scale and mesoscale drivers of rainfall outside orographic lifting and reaffirms the importance of high-resolution numerical modeling for the prediction of extreme precipitation and related natural hazards.},

	abstract = {Abstract In the southwestern U.S., the meteorological phenomenon known as atmospheric rivers (ARs) has gained increasing attention due to its strong connections to floods, snowpacks, and water supplies in the West Coast states. Relatively less is known about the ecological implications of ARs, particularly in the interior Southwest, where AR storms are less common. To address this gap, we compared a chronology of AR landfalls on the west coast between 1989 and 2011 and between 25°N and 42.5°N to annual metrics of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; an indicator of vegetation productivity) and daily resolution precipitation data to assess influences of AR-fed winter precipitation on vegetation productivity across the southwestern U.S. We mapped correlations between winter AR precipitation during landfalling ARs and (1) annual maximum NDVI and (2) area burned by large wildfires summarized by ecoregion during the same year as the landfalls and during the following year. Interannual variations of AR precipitation strongly influenced both NDVI and area burned by wildfire in some dryland ecoregions. The influence of ARs on dryland vegetation varied significantly depending on the latitude of landfall, with those ARs making landfall below 35°N latitude more strongly influencing these systems, and with effects observed as far as 1300 km from the landfall location. As climatologists' understanding of the synoptic patterns associated with the occurrence of ARs continues to evolve, an increased understanding of how AR landfalls, in aggregate, influence vegetation productivity and associated wildfire activity in dryland ecosystems may provide opportunities to better predict ecological responses to climate and climate change.},

AR precipitation features are explored regionally and seasonally using remote sensing (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM version 6 [IMERG V6], daily Global Precipitation Climatology Project version 1.3 [GPCP V1.3], bias-adjusted CPC Morphing Technique version 1 [CMORPH V1], and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks [PERSIANN-CDR]) and reanalysis (MERRA-2 and ECMWF Reanalysis 5th Generation [ERA5]) precipitation products. The results show that most of the world (except the tropics) experience more intense precipitation from AR-related events compared to non-AR events. Over the oceans (especially the Southern Ocean), the contribution of ARs to the total precipitation and extreme events is larger than over land. However, some coastal areas over land are highly affected by ARs (e.g., the western and eastern United States and Canada, Western Europe, North Africa, and part of the Middle East, East Asia, and eastern South America and part of Australia). Although spatial correlations for pairs of IMERG/CMORPH and GPCP/PERSIANN-CDR are fairly high, considerable discrepancies are shown in their estimation of AR-related events (i.e., overall IMERG and CMORPH show a higher fraction of AR-related precipitation). It was found that the degree of consistency between reanalysis and satellite-based products is highly regionally dependent, partly due to the uneven distribution of in situ measurements.},

	abstract = {In this research, rotated principal component analysis was applied to the atmospheric fields associated with a large sample of heavy-rain-producing mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). Cluster analysis in the subspace defined by the leading two resulting principal components revealed two subtypes with distinct synoptic and mesoscale characteristics, which are referred to as warm-season-type and synoptic-type events, respectively. Subsequent composite analysis showed that both subtypes typically occurred on the cool side of a quasi-stationary, low-level frontal boundary, within a region of locally maximized low-level convergence and warm advection. Synoptic-type events, which tended to exhibit greater horizontal extent than warmseason-type events, typically occurred downstream of a progressive upper-level trough, along a low-level potential temperature gradient with the warmest air to the south and southeast. Warm-season-type events, on the other hand, occurred within the right-entrance region of a minimally to anticyclonically curved upperlevel jet streak, along a low-level potential temperature gradient with the warmest low-level air to the southwest. Synoptic-scale forcing for ascent was stronger in synoptic-type events, while low-level moisture was greater in warm-season-type events. Warm-season-type events were frequently preceded by the passage of a trailing-stratiform- (TS) type MCS, whereas synoptic-type events often occurred prior to the passage of a TS-type system. Analysis of the composite vertical wind profiles at the event location suggests that quasistationary behavior in warm-season events predominantly resulted from upstream propagation that nearly canceled advection by the mean steering flow, whereas in the case of synoptic-type events training predominantly resulted from system motion that paralleled a front. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Tornadic and nontornadic outbreaks occur within the United States and elsewhere around the world each year with devastating effect. However, few studies have considered the physical differences between these two outbreak types. To address this issue, synoptic-scale pattern composites of tornadic and nontornadic outbreaks are formulated over North America using a rotated principal component analysis (RPCA). A cluster analysis of the RPC loadings group similar outbreak events, and the resulting map types represent an idealized composite of the constituent cases in each cluster. These composites are used to initialize aWeather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) simulation of each hypothetical composite outbreak type in an effort to determine the WRF's capability to distinguish the outbreak type each composite represents. Synoptic-scale pattern analyses of the composites reveal strikingly different characteristics within each outbreak type, particularly in the wind fields. The tornado outbreak composites reveal a strong low- and midlevel cyclone over the eastern Rockies, which is likely responsible for the observed surface low pressure system in the plains. Composite soundings from the hypothetical outbreak centroids reveal significantly greater bulk shear and storm-relative environmental helicity values in the tornado outbreak environment, whereas instability fields are similar between the two outbreak types. The WRF simulations of the map types confirm results observed in the composite soundings. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {This investigation examines principal component (PC) methodology and the interpretation of the displays, such as eigenvalue magnitude, loadings and scores, which the methodology provides. The key question posed is, to what extent can S- and T-mode decompositions of a dispersion matrix yield the kinds of interpretations placed on them typically? In particular, a series of experiments are designed based on various amalgamations of three distinct synoptic flow patterns. Since these flow patterns are known, a priori, this allows testing via subtle alterations of the methodology to determine whether there is equivalence between the S- and T-mode decompositions, the degree to which the flow patterns or teleconnections can be recovered by each mode, and the interpretation of each mode. The findings are examined in two contexts: how well they classify the flow patterns, and how well they provide meaningful teleconnections. Both correlation and covariance dispersion matrices are used to determine differences that arise from the standardization. Additionally, unrotated and rotated results are included. By examining a variety of commonly applied methodologies, the results hold for a wider range of studies. Key findings are that eigenvalue degeneracy can influence one mode (but not the other) or both modes for any set of flow patterns resulting in pattern intermixing at times. Similarly, such degeneracy is found in one or both dispersion matrices. Congruence coefficients are used to provide a measure of validity by matching the PC loadings to the parent correlations and covariances. This matching is vital as the loadings exhibit dipoles that have been interpreted historically as physically meaningful, but the present work indicates they may arise purely through the methodology. Overall, we observe that S-mode results can be interpreted as teleconnection patterns and T-mode as flow patterns for well-designed analyses that are meticulously scrutinized for methodological problems.

For a state-wide avalanche hazard evaluation, Alaska has been divided into six major snow— avalanche regions on the basis of topography, climatological data, dominant snow—pack conditions, and typical avalanche activity. They are: Arctic Slope, Brooks Range, Western, Interior, South—central, and South—east.Mountainous terrain was studied at scales of 1 : 250 000 and 1 : 1 584000; final compilation was at a scale of 1 : 2 500 000. Regional snow—pack and climatic conditions were cross—correlated with relief zonation of each avalanche region to produce a map of Alaska's provisional snow—avalanche potential.Most of the mountainous areas in the South—central and South—east regions, because of their northern latitude, closeness to large masses of water, and large orographic and cylonic weather processes, are susceptible to major avalanche activity. For areas near population centers, the potential avalanche terrain has been identified from data on known and suspected avalanche activity through air photographs, terrain analysis, and documented snow—avalanche occurrences compiled at scales of 1 : 250 000 and 1 : 63 360.The state—wide regional data compilation and study are initial steps toward avalanche zoning in Alaska. Local land—use planning and detailed investigations are needed to establish effective natural—hazard zoning in municipal areas as related to snow avalanche activity.},

	abstract = {The second version of the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) was made operational at NCEP in March 2011. This version has upgrades to nearly all aspects of the data assimilation and forecast model components of the system. A coupled reanalysis was made over a 32-yr period (1979-2010), which provided the initial conditions to carry out a comprehensive reforecast over 29 years (1982-2010). This was done to obtain consistent and stable calibrations, as well as skill estimates for the operational subseasonal and seasonal predictions at NCEP with CFSv2. The operational implementation of the full system ensures a continuity of the climate record and provides a valuable up-to-date dataset to study many aspects of predictability on the seasonal and subseasonal scales. Evaluation of the reforecasts show that the CFSv2 increases the length of skillful MJO forecasts from 6 to 17 days (dramatically improving subseasonal forecasts), nearly doubles the skill of seasonal forecasts of 2-m temperatures over the United States, and significantly improves global SST forecasts over its predecessor. The CFSv2 not only provides greatly improved guidance at these time scales but also creates many more products for subseasonal and seasonal forecasting with an extensive set of retrospective forecasts for users to calibrate their forecast products. These retrospective and real-time operational forecasts will be used by a wide community of users in their decision making processes in areas such as water management for rivers and agriculture, transportation, energy use by utilities, wind and other sustainable energy, and seasonal prediction of the hurricane season. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL074175},
	abstract = {A new method for automatic detection of atmospheric rivers (ARs) is developed and applied to an atmospheric reanalysis, yielding an extensive catalog of ARs land-falling along the west coast of North America during 1948-2017. This catalog provides a large array of variables that can be used to examine AR cases and their climate-scale variability in exceptional detail. The new record of AR activity, as presented, validated and examined here, provides a perspective on the seasonal cycle and the interannual-interdecadal variability of AR activity affecting the hydroclimate of western North America. Importantly, AR intensity does not exactly follow the climatological pattern of AR frequency. Strong links to hydroclimate are demonstrated using a high-resolution precipitation data set. We describe the seasonal progression of AR activity and diagnose linkages with climate variability expressed in Pacific sea surface temperatures, revealing links to Pacific decadal variability, recent regional anomalies, as well as a generally rising trend in land-falling AR activity. The latter trend is consistent with a long-term increase in vapor transport from the warming North Pacific onto the North American continent. The new catalog provides unprecedented opportunities to study the climate-scale behavior and predictability of ARs affecting western North America. Plain Language Summary We have created a new seven-decade-long catalog of atmospheric river behavior land-falling upon the west coast of North America. The catalog has been validated against independent precipitation observations to ensure that the atmospheric rivers represented therein are associated with extreme orographic precipitation. Our results clearly delineate a prominent role for atmospheric rivers in California's hydroclimate. Atmospheric river variability has been particularly important in the recent California drought as well as its most recent lapse. We also detect a long-term increasing trend in water vapor transport impinging on the west coast of North America associated with atmospheric rivers and overall wintertime water vapor transport associated with climate warming. Our results, moreover, suggest that potential predictability of seasonal behavior of atmospheric rivers may hinge on sources of climatic variability somewhat different from that of total water vapor transport.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have found inconsistent results regarding how wintertime conditions in the Bering Sea relate to variations in the North Pacific climate system. This problem is addressed through analysis of data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis for the period 1950-2003. Composite patterns of sea-level pressure, 500 hPa geopotential heights, storm tracks and surface air temperature are presented for four situations: periods of strong Aleutian Low, weak Aleutian Low, warm Bering Sea air temperatures, and cold Bering Sea air temperatures. Winter temperatures in the Bering Sea are only marginally related to the strength of the Aleutian Low, and are much more sensitive to the position of the Aleutian Low and to variations in storm tracks. In particular, relatively warm temperatures are associated with either an enhanced storm track off the coast of Siberia, and hence anomalous southerly low-level flow, or an enhanced storm track entering the eastern Bering Sea from the southeast. These latter storms do not systematically affect the mean meridional winds, but rather serve to transport mild air of maritime origin over the Bering Sea. The leading indices for the North Pacific, such as the NP and PNA, are more representative of the patterns of tropospheric circulation and storm track anomalies associated with the strength of the Aleutian Low than patterns associated with warm and cold wintertime conditions in the Bering Sea. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Precipitation events along the North American (NA) west coast are strongly modulated by atmospheric rivers, yet the mechanisms of their influences on the probability distributions of precipitation events are not well studied. Simulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) large ensemble under global warming are investigated using a moisture budget conditioned onto precipitation events for the recurrence intervals ranging from 0.1 to 50 years. In the midlatitudes, the increases in precipitation intensity and accumulation for all events over the NA west coast are predominantly controlled by moisture increases. In contrast, changes in the subtropical precipitation distributions in southwestern NA are associated with moisture increases and duration decreases for all events, with additional dynamical amplification for the heaviest precipitation events. These interpretations from the conditional moisture budget are more consistent with future projection of atmospheric rivers than the conventional mean and transient decomposition of the moisture budget.},

	abstract = {Hypothesis: Three surgical approaches, cochleostomy (C), round window (RW), and extended round window (ERW) and two electrodes types, lateral wall (LW) and perimodiolar (PM), account for the vast majority of cochlear implantations. The goal of this study was to analyze the relationship between surgical approach and electrode type with final intracochlear position of the electrode array and subsequent hearing outcomes. Study Design: Comparative longitudinal study. Methods: One hundred postlingually implanted adult patients were enrolled in the study. From the post-operative scan, intracochlear electrode location was determined by using rigid registration, transformed back to the pre-operative CT. Likelihood ratio chi-square statistics were used to evaluate for differences in electrode placement with respect to surgical approach (C, RW, ERW) and type of electrode (LW, PM). Results: Electrode placement completely within the ST was more common for LW than PM designs (89\% vs 58\%, p {\textless} 0.001). RW and ERW approaches were associated with lower rates of electrode placement outside the ST than for the cochleostomy approach (9\%, 16\% and 63\%, respectively, p {\textless} 0.001). This pattern held true regardless of whether the implant was LW or PM. When examining electrode placement and hearing outcome, those with electrode residing completely within the ST had better CNC word scores than patients with any number of electrodes located outside the ST (p=0.045). Conclusion: These data suggest that RW and ERW approaches and LW electrodes are associated with an increased likelihood of successful ST placement. Furthermore, electrode position entirely within the ST confers superior audiological outcomes},

	abstract = {Sitka, located in southeastern coastal Alaska, is the only meteorological station in Alaska and northern coastal British Columbia, with a long climatological record, going back to the first half of the nineteenth century. Sitka was the capital of Alaska, when it was part of the Russian Empire, to which Alaska belonged until 1867, when the American government purchased it. In 1827, the Russian established an observatory on Baranof Island, Sitka Harbor, which made 17-hourly observations, later extended to 19 and thereafter to all hours of the day. When analyzing the data, the 12-day time difference between the Russian (Julian) calendar, at which the observations were made, and ours (Gregorian) has to be considered. The climate of Sitka is maritime, with relative warm winter temperatures—there is no month with a mean temperature below freezing—and moderately warm summer temperatures with 4 months above the 10 °C level and plentiful precipitation all-year long. It is the warmest zone of Alaska. Even though there is a substantial break in observations in the late nineteenth century, these are the only observation, which started so early in the nineteenth century. Systematic US-based observations commenced much later normally in connection with the gold rush, whaling in Northern Alaska, and the fur trade, predominantly along the Yukon River. During the 186 years of observations from 1827 to 2013, the best linear fit gave a temperature increase of 1.56 °C for the whole period or 0.86 °C per century, somewhat lower than expected for the relatively high latitudes. The increase was nonlinear, with several multi-decadal variations. However, when comparing the first normal (1831–1860) to the last normal (1981–2010) and assuming a linear trend, a higher value of 1.06 °C per century was calculated. The discrepancy might be explained by nonlinearity and the fact that during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, observations were sporadic. Furthermore, the observed warming is less pronounced than the values found for Interior and especially Arctic Alaska for later time period for which such a comparison was possible (Wendler et al. 2014). Significant correlation values were found with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the North Pacific (NP) Index, El Nino 3.4, and the 18.4 years nodal tide; the latter was previously reported in an excellent investigation by T. Royer (1993).},

	abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are now widely known for their association with high-impact weather events and long-term water supply in many regions. Researchers within the scientific community have developed numerous methods to identify and track of ARs—a necessary step for analyses on gridded data sets, and objective attribution of impacts to ARs. These different methods have been developed to answer specific research questions and hence use different criteria (e.g., geometry, threshold values of key variables, and time dependence). Furthermore, these methods are often employed using different reanalysis data sets, time periods, and regions of interest. The goal of the Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP) is to understand and quantify uncertainties in AR science that arise due to differences in these methods. This paper presents results for key AR-related metrics based on 20+ different AR identification and tracking methods applied to Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 reanalysis data from January 1980 through June 2017. We show that AR frequency, duration, and seasonality exhibit a wide range of results, while the meridional distribution of these metrics along selected coastal (but not interior) transects are quite similar across methods. Furthermore, methods are grouped into criteria-based clusters, within which the range of results is reduced. AR case studies and an evaluation of individual method deviation from an all-method mean highlight advantages/disadvantages of certain approaches. For example, methods with less (more) restrictive criteria identify more (less) ARs and AR-related impacts. Finally, this paper concludes with a discussion and recommendations for those conducting AR-related research to consider.},

	abstract = {This first paper of the two-part series describes the objectives of the community efforts in improving the Noah land surface model (LSM), documents, through mathematical formulations, the augmented conceptual realism in biophysical and hydrological processes, and introduces a framework for multiple options to parameterize selected processes (Noah-MP). The Noah-MP's performance is evaluated at various local sites using high temporal frequency data sets, and results show the advantages of using multiple optional schemes to interpret the differences in modeling simulations. The second paper focuses on ensemble evaluations with long-term regional (basin) and global scale data sets. The enhanced conceptual realism includes (1) the vegetation canopy energy balance, (2) the layered snowpack, (3) frozen soil and infiltration, (4) soil moisture-groundwater interaction and related runoff production, and (5) vegetation phenology. Sample local-scale validations are conducted over the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) site, the W3 catchment of Sleepers River, Vermont, and a French snow observation site. Noah-MP shows apparent improvements in reproducing surface fluxes, skin temperature over dry periods, snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth, and runoff over Noah LSM version 3.0. Noah-MP improves the SWE simulations due to more accurate simulations of the diurnal variations of the snow skin temperature, which is critical for computing available energy for melting. Noah-MP also improves the simulation of runoff peaks and timing by introducing a more permeable frozen soil and more accurate simulation of snowmelt. We also demonstrate that Noah-MP is an effective research tool by which modeling results for a given process can be interpreted through multiple optional parameterization schemes in the same model framework.

	abstract = {A primary component of the observed recent climate change is the radiative forcing from increased concentrations of long-lived greenhouse gases (LLGHGs). Effective simulation of anthropogenic climate change by general circulation models (GCMs) is strongly dependent on the accurate representation of radiative processes associated with water vapor, ozone, and LLGHGs. In the context of the increasing application of the Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc. (AER), radiation models within the GCM community, their capability to calculate longwave and shortwave radiative forcing for clear sky scenarios previously examined by the radiative transfer model intercomparison project (RTMIP) is presented. Forcing calculations with the AER line-by-line (LBL) models are very consistent with the RTMIP line-by-line results in the longwave and shortwave. The AER broadband models, in all but one case, calculate longwave forcings within a range of -0.20 to 0.23 W m-2 of LBL calculations and shortwave forcings within a range of -0.16 to 0.38 W m-2 of LBL results. These models also perform well at the surface, which RTMIP identified as a level at which GCM radiation models have particular difficulty reproducing LBL fluxes. Heating profile perturbations calculated by the broadband models generally reproduce high-resolution calculations within a few hundredths K d-1 in the troposphere and within 0.15 K d-1 in the peak stratospheric heating near 1 hPa. In most cases, the AER broadband models provide radiative forcing results that are in closer agreement with high-resolution calculations than the GCM radiation codes examined by RTMIP, which supports the application of the AER models to climate change research.

AR termination is more frequent toward the northeastern sectors of North Pacific/Atlantic and adjacent downstream land areas and in the Southern Ocean near Antarctica ({\textasciitilde}1 month−1) compared to the adjacent ocean sectors ({\textasciitilde}0.5 month−1) and least frequent in tropical areas and interior Antarctica where AR genesis is similarly infrequent.

AR travel speed is higher in the midlatitude ocean basins and strongly steered by the zonal wind around 650 hPa. AR tracks are nearly linear in most cases, with the overall travel direction closely correlated with the direction of integrated water vapor transport (r = 0.69) although being more zonal than the latter. Temporally, ARs tend to be longer/stronger around the middle of the life cycle. Seasonal variations in AR life cycle characteristics are also examined. The handling of AR separations/mergers contributes the largest sensitivity in tracking result compared to selection/resolution of input data.},

Participation in Tier 1 is required. Tier 2 will be optional and include sensitivity studies designed around specific science questions, such as reanalysis uncertainty and climate change. High-resolution reanalysis and/or model output will be used wherever possible. Proposed metrics include AR frequency, duration, intensity, and precipitation attributable to ARs.

In this study, a ridge detection algorithm is developed and applied on daily geopotential height anomalies to track and quantify the diversity of individual ridge characteristics (e.g., position, frequency, magnitude, extent, and persistence). Three dominant ridge types are shown to play important, but differing, roles for influencing the location of landfalling atmospheric rivers (ARs), precipitation, and subsequently meteorological drought. For California, a combination of these ridge types is important for influencing precipitation deficits on daily through seasonal time scales, indicating the various pathways by which ridging can induce drought. Furthermore, both the frequency of ridge types and reduced AR activity are necessary features for explaining drought variability on seasonal time scales across the western and southwestern regions. The three ridge types are found to be associated in different ways with various remote drivers and modes of variability, highlighting possible sources of subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) predictability. A comparison between ridge types shows that anomalously large and persistent ridging events relate to different Rossby wave trains across the Pacific with different preferential upstream locations of tropical heating. For the "South-ridge" type, centered over the Southwest, a positive trend is found in both the frequency and persistence of these events across recent decades, likely contributing to observed regional drying. These results illustrate the utility of feature tracking for characterizing a wider range of ridging features that collectively influence precipitation deficits and drought.},

However, the sparse observational network in Alaska limits our understanding of meteorological variability, particularly of precipitation processes that influence the hydrologic cycle. Here, a new 14-yr (September 2002-August 2016) dataset for Alaska with 4-km grid spacing is described and evaluated. The dataset, generated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, is useful for gaining insight into meteorological and hydrologic processes, and provides a baseline against which to measure future environmental change. The WRF fields are evaluated at annual, seasonal, and daily time scales against observation-based gridded and station records of 2-m air temperature, precipitation, and snowfall. Pattern correlations between annual mean WRF and observation-based gridded fields are r = 0.89 for 2-m temperature, r = 0.75 for precipitation, r = 0.82 for snow-day fraction, r = 0.55 for first snow day of the season, and r = 0.71 for last snow day of the season. A shortcoming of the WRF dataset is that spring snowmelt occurs too early over a majority of the state, due partly to positive 2-m temperature biases in winter and spring. Strengths include an improved representation of the interannual variability of 2-m temperature and precipitation and accurately simulated (relative to regional station observations) winter and summer precipitation maxima. This initial evaluation suggests that the 4-km WRF climate dataset robustly simulates meteorological processes and recent climatic variability in Alaska. The dataset may be particularly useful for applications that require high-temporal-frequency weather fields, such as driving hydrologic or glacier models. Future studies will provide further insight on its ability to represent other aspects of Alaska's climate.},

	abstract = {An intercomparison of high-latitude precipitation characteristics from observation-based and reanalysis products is performed. In particular, the precipitation products from CloudSat provide an independent assessment to other widely used products, these being the observationally based Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), Global Precipitation Climatology Centre, and Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) products and the ERA-Interim, Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and National Centers for Environmental Prediction-Department of Energy Reanalysis 2 (NCEP-DOE R2) reanalyses. Seasonal and annual total precipitation in both hemispheres poleward of 55° latitude are considered in all products, and CloudSat is used to assess intensity and frequency of precipitation occurrence by phase, defined as rain, snow, or mixed phase. Furthermore, an independent estimate of snow accumulation during the cold season was calculated from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment. The intercomparison is performed for the 2007-2010 period when CloudSat was fully operational. It is found that ERA-Interim and MERRA are broadly similar, agreeing more closely with CloudSat over oceans. ERA-Interim also agrees well with CloudSat estimates of snowfall over Antarctica where total snowfall from GPCP and CloudSat is almost identical. A number of disagreements on regional or seasonal scales are identified: CMAP reports much lower ocean precipitation relative to other products, NCEP-DOE R2 reports much higher summer precipitation over Northern Hemisphere land, GPCP reports much higher snowfall over Eurasia, and CloudSat overestimates precipitation over Greenland, likely due to mischaracterization of rain and mixed-phase precipitation. These outliers are likely unrealistic for these specific regions and time periods. These estimates from observations and reanalyses provide useful insights for diagnostic assessment of precipitation products in high latitudes, quantifying the current uncertainties, improving the products, and establishing a benchmark for assessment of climate models.},

In this study, we performed a systematic review of the available literature to assess the performance of the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) products across different geographical locations and climatic conditions around the globe. Asia, and in particular China, are the subject of the largest number of IMERG evaluation studies on the continental and country level. When compared to ground observational records, IMERG is found to vary with seasons, as well as precipitation type, structure, and intensity. It is shown to appropriately estimate and detect regional precipitation patterns, and their spatial mean, while its performance can be improved over mountainous regions characterized by orographic precipitation, complex terrains, and for winter precipitation. Furthermore, despite IMERG's better performance compared to other satellite products in reproducing spatio-temporal patterns and variability of extreme precipitation, some limitations were found regarding the precipitation intensity. At the temporal scales, IMERG performs better at monthly and annual time steps than the daily and sub-daily ones. Finally, in terms of hydrological application, the use of IMERG has resulted in significant discrepancies in streamflow simulation. However, and most importantly, we find that each new version that replaces the previous one, shows substantial improvement in almost every spatiotemporal scale and climatic condition. Thus, despite its limitations, IMERG evolution reveals a promising path for current and future applications.},

We classified potential effects discussed in the literature into categories according to climate driver, type of environmental service affected, certainty and timing of the effects, and potential magnitude of economic consequences. We then described the nature of important economic effects and provided estimates of larger, more certain effects for which data were available. Largest economic effects were associated with costs to prevent damage, relocate, and replace infrastructure threatened by permafrost thaw, sea level rise, and coastal erosion. The costs to infrastructure were offset by a large projected reduction in space heating costs attributable to milder winters. Overall, we estimated that five relatively certain, large effects that could be readily quantified would impose an annual net cost of \$340–\$700 million, or 0.6\%–1.3\% of Alaska’s GDP. This significant, but relatively modest, net economic effect for Alaska as a whole obscures large regional disparities, as rural communities face large projected costs while more southerly urban residents experience net gains.},

The influence of exposure to wind and yellow cedar decline on the landslide regime of Alaskan temperate rainforests was explored using presence-only modeling techniques. The wind regime was found to be a significant influence on the spatial distribution of landslide events. This effect was mediated by slope, with little interactive effects at low angles and stronger influences on steeper slopes. Mechanistically, the interaction appears to be mediated by root strength, which is an important factor in stability of high-angle slopes. Yellow cedar decline, despite increasing landslide susceptibility in fine-scale studies, was not significant-although a stronger relationship may develop with time. Overall, inclusion of other disturbances in the modeling framework resulted in a significant spatial refinement when predicting landslide susceptibility. This results from the varying importance of individual disturbance drivers across the landscape, of which only a subset are exposed to potential disturbance interactions. This spatial effect is an important consideration when characterizing landscape-scale disturbance regimes and their interactions with other disturbances.},

This study uses a combination of satellite remote sensing, field observations, and modeling to improve our understanding of the dynamics of these flows. After examining several thousand synthetic aperture radar (SAR) high-resolution wind speed images over the Gulf of Alaska, several subclasses of barrier jets were identified that do not fit the current conceptual model of barrier jet development. This conceptual model consists of an acceleration and turning of the ambient cross-barrier flow into the along-barrier direction when the ambient low-level flow is blocked by terrain; however, the SAR imagery showed many barrier jet cases with significant flow variability in the along-coast direction as well as evidence for the influence of cold, dry continental air exiting the gaps in coastal terrain. A sub-class of jets has been observed where the transition from the coastal to the offshore flow is abrupt. The results from these climatological studies have motivated modeling studies of selected events as well as field observations from the Southeast Alaska Regional Jets (SARJET) experiment field campaign in the Gulf of Alaska during fall of 2004. This paper will highlight preliminary results obtained during SARJET, which collected in situ measurements of barrier jets and gap flows using the University of Wyoming's King Air research aircraft. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

This study explores where hourly rainfall in the state meets or exceeds published values thought to trigger landslides after crossing a seasonal antecedent precipitation threshold. We answer the following questions: 1) Where in California are overthreshold events most common? 2) How are events distributed within the cool season (October-May) and interannually? 3) Are these events related to atmospheric rivers? To do this, we compile and quality control hourly precipitation data over a 22-yr period for 147 Remote Automated Weather Stations (RAWS). Stations in the Transverse and Coast Ranges and portions of the northwestern Sierra Nevada have the greatest number of rainfall events exceeding thresholds. Atmospheric rivers coincide with 60\%-90\% of these events. Overthreshold events tend to occur in the climatological wettest month of the year, and they commonly occur multiple times within a storm. These statewide maps depict where to expect intense rainfalls that have historically triggered shallow landslides. They predict that some areas of California are less susceptible to storm-driven landslides solely because high-intensity rainfall is unlikely.},

	abstract = {Warming of the Earth climate system is unequivocal. That climate changes affect the stability of natural and engineered slopes and have consequences on landslides, is also undisputable. Less clear is the type, extent, magnitude and direction of the changes in the stability conditions, and on the location, abundance, activity and frequency of landslides in response to the projected climate changes. Climate and landslides act at only partially overlapping spatial and temporal scales, complicating the evaluation of the climate impacts on landslides. We review the literature on landslide-climate studies, and find a bias in their geographical distribution, with large parts of the world not investigated. We recommend to fill the gap with new studies in Asia, South America, and Africa. We examine advantages and limits of the approaches adopted to evaluate the effects of climate variations on landslides, including prospective modelling and retrospective methods that use landslide and climate records. We consider changes in temperature, precipitation, wind and weather systems, and their direct and indirect effects on the stability of single slopes, and we use a probabilistic landslide hazard model to appraise regional landslide changes. Our review indicates that the modelling results of landslide-climate studies depend more on the emission scenarios, the Global Circulation Models, and the methods to downscale the climate variables, than on the description of the variables controlling slope processes. We advocate for constructing ensembles of projections based on a range of emissions scenarios, and to use carefully results from worst-case scenarios that may over/under-estimate landslide hazards and risk. We further advocate that uncertainties in the landslide projections must be quantified and communicated to decision makers and the public. We perform a preliminary global assessment of the future landslide impact, and we present a global map of the projected impact of climate change on landslide activity and abundance. Where global warming is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of severe rainfall events, a primary trigger of rapid-moving landslides that cause many landslide fatalities, we predict an increase in the number of people exposed to landslide risk. Finally, we give recommendations for landslide adaptation and risk reduction strategies in the framework of a warming climate.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the evolution of two zonally elongated atmospheric rivers (ARs) that produced {\textgreater}200mm of rainfall over mountainous regions of Northern California in late October 2010. Synoptic-scale analysis and air parcel trajectory analysis indicate that the ARs developed within high-CAPE environments characterized by troposphere-deep ascent as water vapor was transported directly from western North Pacific tropical cyclones (TCs) toward the equatorward entrance region of an intensifying North Pacific jet stream (NPJ). The same ARs were subsequently maintained as water vapor was transported from extratropical and subtropical regions over the central and eastern North Pacific in an environment characterized by quasigeostrophic forcing for ascent and strong frontogenesis along the anticyclonic shear side of an intense and zonally extended NPJ. Although the ARs developed in conjunction with water vapor transported from regions near TCs and in the presence of troposphere-deep ascent, an atmospheric water vapor budget illustrates that decreases in integrated water vapor (IWV) via precipitation are largely offset by the horizontal aggregation of water vapor along the AR corridors via IWV flux convergence in the presence of frontogenesis. The frameworks used for investigations of predecessor rain events ahead of TCs and of interactions between recurving TCs and the NPJ are also utilized to illustrate many dynamically similar processes related to AR development and evolution. Similarities include the following: water vapor transport directly from a TC, troposphere-deep ascent in a high-CAPE environment beneath the equatorward entrance region of an intensifying upper-tropospheric jet streak, interactions between diabatic outflow and an upper-tropospheric jet streak, and strong frontogenesis. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a revised vertical diffusion package with a nonlocal turbulent mixing coefficient in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Based on the study of Noh et al. and accumulated results of the behavior of the Hong and Pan algorithm, a revised vertical diffusion algorithm that is suitable for weather forecasting and climate prediction models is developed. The major ingredient of the revision is the inclusion of an explicit treatment of entrainment processes at the top of the PBL. The new diffusion package is called the Yonsei University PBL (YSU PBL). In a one-dimensional offline test framework, the revised scheme is found to improve several features compared with the Hong and Pan implementation. The YSU PBL increases boundary layer mixing in the thermally induced free convection regime and decreases it in the mechanically induced forced convection regime, which alleviates the well-known problems in the Medium-Range Forecast (MRF) PBL. Excessive mixing in the mixed layer in the presence of strong winds is resolved. Overly rapid growth of the PBL in the case of the Hong and Pan is also rectified. The scheme has been successfully implemented in the Weather Research and Forecast model producing a more realistic structure of the PBL and its development. In a case study of a frontal tornado outbreak, it is found that some systematic biases of the large-scale features such as an afternoon cold bias at 850 hPa in the MRF PBL are resolved. Consequently, the new scheme does a better job in reproducing the convective inhibition. Because the convective inhibition is accurately predicted, widespread light precipitation ahead of a front, in the case of the MRF PBL, is reduced. In the frontal region, the YSU PBL scheme improves some characteristics, such as a double line of intense convection. This is because the boundary layer from the YSU PBL scheme remains less diluted by entrainment leaving more fuel for severe convection when the front triggers it. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

As compared with earlier single-moment BMPs, the new scheme incorporates a large number of improvements to both physical processes and computer coding, and it employs many techniques found in far more sophisticated spectral/bin schemes using lookup tables. Unlike any other BMP, the assumed snow size distribution depends on both ice water content and temperature and is represented as a sum of exponential and gamma distributions. Furthermore, snow assumes a nonspherical shape with a bulk density that varies inversely with diameter as found in observations and in contrast to nearly all other BMPs that assume spherical snow with constant density. The new scheme's snow category was readily modified to match previous research in sensitivity experiments designed to test the sphericity and distribution shape characteristics. From analysis of four idealized sensitivity experiments, it was determined that the sphericity and constant density assumptions play a major role in producing supercooled liquid water whereas the assumed distribution shape plays a lesser, but nonnegligible, role. Further testing using numerous case studies and comparing model results with in situ and other observations confirmed the results of the idealized experiments and are briefly mentioned herein, but more detailed, microphysical comparisons with observations are found in a companion paper in this series (Part III, forthcoming). © 2008 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {The Transverse Ranges of southern California often experience fire followed by flood. This sequence sometimes causes post-fire debris flows (PFDFs) that threaten life and property situated on alluvial fans. The combination of steep topography, highly erodible rock and soil, and wildfire, coupled with intense rainfall, can initiate PFDFs even in cases of relatively small storm rainfall totals. This study identifies common atmospheric conditions during which damaging PFDFs occur in the Transverse Ranges during the cool season, defined here as November–March. A compilation of 93 PFDF events during 1980–2014 triggered by 19 precipitation events is compared against previous studies of the events, reanalysis, precipitation, and radar data to estimate PFDF trigger times. Each event was analyzed to determine common atmospheric features and their range of values present at and preceding the trigger time. Results show atmospheric rivers are a dominant feature, observed in 13 of the 19 events. Other common features include low-level winds orthogonal to the Transverse Ranges and other conditions favorable for orographic forcing, a strong upper level jet south of the region, and moist-neutral static stability. Several events included closed low-pressure systems or narrow cold frontal rain bands. These findings can help forecasters identify more precisely the synoptic-scale atmospheric conditions required to produce PFDF-triggering rainfall and thus reduce uncertainty when issuing warnings.},

	abstract = {Upstream orographic enhancement of the rainfall from an extratropical cyclone approaching the Andes from the Pacific is investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar. The main precipitation from the cyclone over central and coastal Chile fell when a narrow cold-frontal rainband (NCFR) interacted with a midlevel layer cloud deck formed from the orographically induced ascent of the prefrontal "atmospheric river" upstream of the Andes. Model output indicates that low-level convergence enhanced the NCFR where it met low-level blocked flow near the mountains. The NCFR had stronger updrafts with decreasing distance from the mountains, and the NCFR produced larger rain accumulations over the land region upstream of the Andes than over the open ocean. A sensitivity simulation with a 50\% reduction in the Andes topography, for comparison to various west coast mountain ranges of North America, demonstrates that the extreme height of the real mountain barrier strengthens frontogenesis and upstream blocking, which produces stronger frontal lifting and a slower progression of the frontal system. The model and the satellite data suggest that the larger precipitation rates upstream of the Andes resulted from a seeder-feeder effect connected with the orographically invigorated NCFR updrafts, when they penetrated the orographically enhanced midlevel stratiform clouds forming as a result of the upstream orographic ascent of the atmospheric river. The supercooled water of the NCFR updrafts formed a feeder zone for the snow particles in the midlevel stratiform cloud just upstream of the Andes. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Precipitation estimation by weather radars in Alaska is challenging. In this study, we investigate National Weather Service (NWS) precipitation products that are produced from the seven NEXRAD radar sites in Alaska. The NWS precipitation processing subsystem generates stages of data at each NEXRAD site which are then input to the weather forecast office to generate a regionwide precipitation product. Data from the NEXRAD sites and the operational rain gauges in the weather forecast region are used to produce this regionwide product that is then sent to the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to be included in the NCEP Stage IV distribution. The NCEP Stage IV product for Alaska has been available since 2017. We use the United States Climate Reference Network (USCRN) data from Alaska to compare to the NCEP Stage IV data. Given that the USCRN can be used in the production of the NCEP Stage IV data for Alaska, we also used the NEXRAD Digital Precipitation Array (DPA) that is generated at the site for comparison of the radar-only products. Comparing the NEXRAD-based data from Alaska to the USCRN gauge estimates using the USCRN site information on air temperature, we are able to condition the analysis based on the hourly or 6-hourly average air temperature. The estimates in the frozen phase of precipitation largely underestimate as compared to the gauge, and the correlation is low with larger errors as compared to other phases of precipitation. In the mixed phase the underestimation of precipitation improves, but the correlation is still low with relatively large errors as compared to the rain phases of precipitation. The difficulties in precipitation estimation in cold temperatures are well known and we show the evaluation for the NCEP Stage IV regional data for Alaska and the NEXRAD site specific Digital Precipitation Array (DPA) data. Results show the challenges of estimating mixed-phase and frozen precipitation. However, the DPA data shows somewhat better performance in the mixed precipitation phase, which suggests that the NWS Precipitation Processing Subsystem (PPS) is tuned to the climatology as it relates to precipitation in Alaska.},

Stakeholders can utilize these enhanced-resolution data to investigate climate- and weather-related phenomena in Alaska. Temperature and precipitation are analyzed and compared among ERA-Interim, WRF Model downscaling, and in situ observations. Relative to ERA-Interim, the downscaling is shown to improve the spatial representation of temperature and precipitation around Alaska's complex terrain. Improvements include increased winter and decreased summer higher-elevation downscaled seasonal average temperatures. Precipitation is also enhanced over higher elevations in all seasons relative to the reanalysis. These spatial distributions of temperature and precipitation are consistent with the few available gridded observational datasets that account for topography. The downscaled precipitation generally exceeds observationally derived estimates in all seasons over mainland Alaska, and it is less than observations in the southeast. Temperature biases tended to be more mixed, and the downscaling reduces absolute bias at higher elevations, especially in winter. Careful selection of data for local site analysis from the downscaling can help to reduce these biases, especially those due to inconsistencies in elevation. Improved meteorological station coverage at higher elevations will be necessary to better evaluate gridded downscaled products in Alaska because biases vary and may even change sign with elevation.},

This study quantifies the contribution of ARs to annual, seasonal, and extreme precipitation across BCSAK from 1979 to 2012 using a recently developed high-resolution gridded precipitation data set, a regional AR catalog, and integrated vapor transport fields calculated from a reanalysis data set. On average, ARs contribute 13\% of total annual precipitation with the higher contribution along the coastal regions (up to 33\%), parts of which are one of the wettest locations on Earth, followed by the Columbia and Rocky Mountains ({\textasciitilde}9\%–15\%). The highest contributions occur during September (up to 57\%) and October (up to 49\%). The contribution of ARs to extreme precipitation attains {\textgreater}90\% along the western arc of the Coast Mountains and the coastal regions of BCSAK. ARs act as the main synoptic-scale mechanism that brings rainfall to the Rocky Mountains in winter. The probability of observing AR-related precipitation increases over the study period; however, no change occurs in the average AR-related precipitation amount for most of BCSAK during 1979–2012. This work provides insights on the critical role ARs play on the water resources of northwestern North America and has broader implications on community water supply and management, hydropower operations, and flood risk assessment and mitigation.},

Datasets used include gauged runoff from 168 unregulated watersheds, topographic characteristics of those watersheds, a regional AR catalog, and integrated vapor transport fields for water years (WYs) 1979–2016. ARs contribute;22\% of annual river runoff along the Coast and Insular Mountains watersheds, which decreases inland to;11\% in the watersheds of the Interior Mountains and Plateau. Average association between ARs and annual maximum river runoff attains {\textgreater}80\%, {\textgreater}50\%, and {\textless}50\% along the watersheds of the western flanks of the Coast Mountains, the Interior Mountains, and Interior Plateau, respectively. There is no significant change in AR-related extreme annual maximum runoff across BCSAK during 1979–2016. AR conditions occur during 25 out of 32 of the flood-related natural disasters in British Columbia during WYs 1979–2016. AR-related annual maximum runoff magnitude is significantly higher than non-AR-related annual maximum runoff for 30\% of the watersheds studied. Smaller and steeper watersheds closer to the coast are more susceptible to AR-related annual maximum runoff than their inland counterparts. These results illustrate the importance of AR activity as a major control for the distribution of peak runoff in BCSAK. This work provides insights on the hydrological response of watersheds of northwestern North America to landfalling ARs that may improve flood risk assessment and disaster management in this region.},

	abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

The processes responsible for this mesoscale lowering of the snow line are examined in semi-idealized simulations with a mesoscale numerical model and in simpler theoretical models. Spatial variations in latent cooling from melting precipitation, in adiabatic cooling from vertical motion, and in the melting distance of frozen hydrometeors are all shown to make important contributions. The magnitude of the snow line drop, and the relative importance of the responsible processes, depends on properties of the incoming flow and terrain geometry. Results suggest that the depression of the snow line increases with increasing temperature, a relationship that, if present in nature, could act to buffer mountain hydroclimates against the impacts of climate warming. The simulated melting distance, and hence the snow line, depends substantially on the choice of microphysical parameterization, pointing to an important source of uncertainty in simulations of mountain snowfall. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {The maritime mountain ranges of western North America span a wide range of elevations and are extremely sensitive to flooding from warm winter storms, primarily because rain falls at higher elevations and over a much greater fraction of a basin's contributing area than during a typical storm. Accurate predictions of this rain-snow line are crucial to hydrologic forecasting. This study examines how remotely sensed atmospheric snow levels measured upstream of a mountain range (specifically, the bright band measured above radar wind profilers) can be used to accurately portray the altitude of the surface transition from snow to rain along the mountain's windward slopes, focusing on measurements in the Sierra Nevada, California, from 2001 to 2005. Snow accumulation varies with respect to surface temperature, diurnal cycles in solar radiation, and fluctuations in the free-tropospheric melting level. At 1.5°C, 50\% of precipitation events fall as rain and 50\% as snow, and on average, 50\% of measured precipitation contributes to increases in snow water equivalent (SWE). Between 2.5° and 3°C, snow is equally likely to melt or accumulate, with most cases resulting in no change to SWE. Qualitatively, brightband heights (BBHs) detected by 915-MHz profiling radars up to 300 km away from the American River study basin agree well with surface melting patterns. Quantitatively, this agreement can be improved by adjusting the melting elevation based on the spatial location of the profiler relative to the basin: BBHs decrease with increasing latitude and decreasing distance to the windward slope of the Sierra Nevada. Because of diurnal heating and cooling by radiation at the mountain surface, BBHs should also be adjusted to higher surface elevations near midday and lower elevations near midnight. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {The heights of the atmospheric freezing level have increased over most glacierized areas of High Asia during 1971-2010, especially in the Altai Mountains, the eastern Tianshan Mountains, and the northeastern margins of the Tibetan Plateau. The systematic increase of freezing level heights (FLHs) is evidenced from both radiosonde and National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis data. Eleven glaciers with long-term observations are selected in typical high-elevation mountain ranges to examine the relationship between changes in FLHs and cryospheric response. Long-term trends in glacier mass balance and equilibrium line altitude (ELA) show significant correlations with changes in FLHs. A rise of 10 m in summer FLH causes mass balance of reference glaciers in High Asia to decrease by between 7 and 38-mm (water equivalent) and ELA to increase by between 3.1 and 9.8-m, respectively, depending on location. Both relationships are statistically significant (p-{\textless}-0.01) for most reference glaciers. Thus, rapid deglaciation in these high mountain ranges during recent decades is related to the increase in FLH.

	abstract = {Based on observations from a hydrometeorological network on the eastern slopes of the Annapurna Range, nearly all the annual precipitation at low elevations ({\textless} 2000 in MSL) in Nepal is in liquid form, even during the winter. However, high elevations ({\textgreater} 3000 in MSL) can receive up to 40\% of their annual precipitation as snowfall during the winter, with the highest altitude stations (∼4000 m MSL and above) having the most total winter precipitation (which can exceed 100 cm). Significant snowstorms are associated with terrain-locked low-pressure systems that form when an upper-level disturbance passes over the notch formed by the Himalayas and Hindu Kush mountains (the so-called Western Disturbances), causing upper-level SW flow over central Nepal and orographically forced precipitation. Based on these results, a 30-year (1973-2002) climatology of these notch depressions is developed and reveals that significant interannual variability in central Himalayan winter storms exists. Weak but statistically significant correlation between notch depressions and the Polar/Eurasia teleconnection pattern was found, suggesting that the strength of the circumpolar vortex may affect the number of depressions passing through the Himalayan region. A typical snow event (11 February 2000) was the subject of an observational and modeling case study. Local precipitation (snow and rain) and other meteorological observations, as well as satellite (Meteosat-5 and TRMM) and NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data were used, along with a cloud-resolving model with realistic topography. This study shows that significant winter-time precipitation only occurs in the central Himalayas when the large-scale flow evolves to a favorable geometry with respect to the mountains. © 2004, Meteorological Society of Japan.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs) that reach the complex terrain of High Mountain Asia (HMA) cause significant hydrological impacts for millions of people. While ARs are often associated with precipitation extremes and can cause floods and debris flows affecting populated communities, little is known about ARs that reach as far inland as HMA. This paper characterizes AR types and investigates dynamical mechanisms associated with the development of ARs that typically affect HMA. Combined empirical orthogonal function (cEOF) analysis using integrated water vapor transport (IVT) is applied to days where an AR reaches HMA. K-means cluster analysis applied to the first two principal components uncovered three subtypes of AR events with distinct synoptic characteristics during winter and spring months. The first subtype increases precipitation and IVT in Western HMA and is associated with a zonally oriented wave train propagating within the westerly jet waveguide. The second subtype is associated with enhanced southwesterly IVT, anomalous upper-level cyclonic circulation centered on 45 \$\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ \$\$ E, and precipitation in Northwestern HMA. The third subtype shows anomalous precipitation in Eastern HMA and southwesterly IVT across the Bay of Bengal. Interannual variations in the frequency of HMA ARs and relationships with various teleconnection patterns show that western HMA AR subtypes are sensitive to well-known remote large-scale climate factors, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, and the Siberian High. These results provide synoptic characterization of the three types of ARs that reach HMA and reveal the previously unexplored significance of their contribution to winter and spring precipitation.},

Previous landslide research has qualitatively estimated how patterns in landslide activity may change based on climate change scenarios. We present the first quantitative view of potential modulation in future landslide activity over the High Mountain Asia region leveraging a new landslide hazard model and precipitation data from satellite and Global Climate Model sources. In doing so, we find that the rate of increase in landslide activity at the end of the century is expected to be greatest over areas covered by current glaciers and glacial lakes, potentially exacerbating the impacts of cascading hazards on populations downstream.

	abstract = {Southern California water resources are heavily dependent on a small number of extreme precipitation events each winter season, which dictate the region's highly variable interannual accumulations. In the Santa Ana River Watershed, on average, three extreme events per year contribute half of annual precipitation, yet there are relatively few studies of the synoptic to mesoscale processes that drive precipitation during these events. This study uses an ingredient-based approach in identifying the contributions of orographic forcing, dynamical forcing, and convective instability to extreme precipitation in the watershed in 107 storms that produced roughly 50\% of all precipitation from 1981 to 2017. The influence of dynamical forcing and convective instability on event precipitation distributions is investigated relative to the dominant influence of orographic forcing that is typically found in landfalling atmospheric rivers. Case studies of two high-impact events from the 2017 winter season demonstrate differences in the roles of synoptic ascent and mesoscale convective features in modifying precipitation location, rate, and accumulation over the watershed. The 17 and 18 February 2017 case study included a narrow cold-frontal rainband that produced high-intensity short-duration precipitation over low elevations of the watershed. In the 107 extreme event records, similar modification of the precipitation distribution toward non-orographic rainfall was related to significant changes in the synoptic-scale circulation that favored enhanced dynamics and upstream ascent associated with frontogenesis. Variability in precipitation mechanisms is of primary interest to weather forecasters and water managers as it modifies event impacts and predictability. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

Focusing on California's Sierra Nevada, the study identifies ROS occurrences and their connection with ARs during the 1998-2014 winters. AR conditions, which occur during 17\% of all precipitation events, are associated with 50\% of ROS events (25 of 50). Composite analysis shows that compared to ARs without ROS, ARs with ROS are on average warmer by ∼2 K, with snow water equivalent loss of ∼0.7 cm/d (providing 20\% of the combined water available for runoff) and ∼50\% larger streamflow/precipitation ratios. Atmospheric Infrared Sounder retrievals reveal distinct offshore characteristics of the two types of ARs.

	abstract = {Data for the Hindu Kush–Karakoram–Himalaya region from satellite laser altimetry and a global elevation model shows that glacier thinning varied by an order of magnitude across the region, with surface debris not seeming to provide effective insulation, and that the melting ice added several per cent to the annual discharge of the mountain rivers. Glacier changes over the high mountains of Asia can have knock-on effects on water resources and sea levels, but it has been difficult to accurately monitor ice-mass changes. A recent gravimetric survey of mass loss in ice-covered areas around the globe — published in Nature — suggested that the high mountains of Asia were approximately in balance during the early twenty-first century. Now, Andreas Kaab and colleagues present a more detailed analysis using satellite altimetry and show a small but statistically distinguishable mass loss from the Hindu Kush–Karakoram–Himalaya region. A larger mass loss in much of the Hindu Kush–Himalaya was partly offset by a scarcely distinguishable mass loss in the Karakoram. Glaciers are among the best indicators of terrestrial climate variability, contribute importantly to water resources in many mountainous regions1,2 and are a major contributor to global sea level rise3,4. In the Hindu Kush–Karakoram–Himalaya region (HKKH), a paucity of appropriate glacier data has prevented a comprehensive assessment of current regional mass balance5. There is, however, indirect evidence of a complex pattern of glacial responses5,6,7,8 in reaction to heterogeneous climate change signals9. Here we use satellite laser altimetry and a global elevation model to show widespread glacier wastage in the eastern, central and south-western parts of the HKKH during 2003–08. Maximal regional thinning rates were 0.66 ± 0.09 metres per year in the Jammu–Kashmir region. Conversely, in the Karakoram, glaciers thinned only slightly by a few centimetres per year. Contrary to expectations, regionally averaged thinning rates under debris-mantled ice were similar to those of clean ice despite insulation by debris covers. The 2003–08 specific mass balance for our entire HKKH study region was −0.21 ± 0.05 m yr−1 water equivalent, significantly less negative than the estimated global average for glaciers and ice caps4,10. This difference is mainly an effect of the balanced glacier mass budget in the Karakoram. The HKKH sea level contribution amounts to one per cent of the present-day sea level rise11. Our 2003–08 mass budget of −12.8 ± 3.5 gigatonnes (Gt) per year is more negative than recent satellite-gravimetry-based estimates of −5 ± 3 Gt yr−1 over 2003–10 (ref. 12). For the mountain catchments of the Indus and Ganges basins13, the glacier imbalance contributed about 3.5\% and about 2.0\%, respectively, to the annual average river discharge13, and up to 10\% for the Upper Indus basin14.},

	abstract = {The western United States is vulnerable to socioeconomic disruption due to extreme winter precipitation and floods. Traditionally, forecasts of precipitation and river discharge provide the basis for preparations. Herein we show that earlier event awareness may be possible through use of horizontal water vapor transport (integrated vapor transport (IVT)) forecasts. Applying the potential predictability concept to the National Centers for Environmental Prediction global ensemble reforecasts, across 31 winters, IVT is found to be more predictable than precipitation. IVT ensemble forecasts with the smallest spreads (least forecast uncertainty) are associated with initiation states with anomalously high geopotential heights south of Alaska, a setup conducive for anticyclonic conditions and weak IVT into the western United States. IVT ensemble forecasts with the greatest spreads (most forecast uncertainty) have initiation states with anomalously low geopotential heights south of Alaska and correspond to atmospheric rivers. The greater IVT predictability could provide warnings of impending storminess with additional lead times for hydrometeorological applications.},

	abstract = {A complex and underexplored relationship exists between atmospheric rivers (ARs) and mesoscale frontal waves (MFWs). The present study further explores and quantifies the importance of diabatic processes to MFW development and the AR-MFW interaction by simulating two ARs impacting Northern California's flood-vulnerable Russian River watershed using the Model for Prediction Across Scales-Atmosphere (MPAS-A) with and without the effects of latent heating. Despite the storms' contrasting characteristics, diabatic processes within the system were critical to the development of MFWs, the timing and magnitude of integrated vapor transport (IVT), and precipitation impacts over the Russian River watershed in both cases. Low-altitude circulations and lower-tropospheric moisture content in and around the MFWs are considerably reduced without latent heating, contributing to a decrease in moisture transport, moisture convergence, and IVT. Differences in IVT are not consistently dynamic (i.e., wind-driven) or thermodynamic (i.e., moisture-driven), but instead vary by case and by time throughout each event. For one event, AR conditions over the watershed persisted for 6 h less and the peak IVT occurred 6 h earlier and was reduced by {\textasciitilde}17\%; weaker orographic and dynamic precipitation forcings reduced precipitation totals by {\textasciitilde}64\%. Similarly, turning off latent heating shortened the second event by 24 h and reduced precipitation totals by {\textasciitilde}49\%; the maximum IVT over the watershed was weakened by {\textasciitilde}42\% and delayed by 18 h. Thus, sufficient representation of diabatic processes, and by inference, water vapor initial conditions, is critical for resolving MFWs, their feedbacks on AR evolution, and associated precipitation forecasts on watershed scales.},

	abstract = {Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) forecasts of weather and climate extremes are being increasingly demanded by water resource managers, operational forecasters, and other users in the applications community. This study uses hindcast data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) S2S forecast system to evaluate global subseasonal prediction skill of atmospheric rivers (ARs), which are intense lower tropospheric plumes of moisture transport that often project strongly onto extreme precipitation. An aggregate quantity is introduced to assess AR subseasonal prediction skill, defined as the number of AR days occurring over a week-long period (AR1wk occurrence). The observed pattern of seasonal mean AR1wk occurrence strongly resembles the general pattern of daily AR frequency. The ECMWF S2S forecast system generally shows positive (negative) biases relative to reanalysis in the mid-latitude regions in summer (winter) of up to 0.5–1.0 AR days in AR1wk occurrence in regions of highest AR activity. ECMWF AR1wk occurrence forecast skill outperforms a reference forecast based on monthly climatology of AR1wk occurrence at week-3 (14–20 days) lead over a number of subtropical to midlatitude regions, with slightly better skill evident in wintertime. The magnitude and subseasonal forecast skill of AR1wk occurrence are shown to vary interannually, and both quantities are modulated during certain phases of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, Pacific–North America teleconnection pattern, and Madden–Julian Oscillation.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.geomorph.2015.03.016},
	abstract = {Landslide inventories are critical to support investigations of where and when landslides have happened and may occur in the future; however, there is surprisingly little information on the historical occurrence of landslides at the global scale. This paper presents a new publicly available global landslide catalog (GLC), which is based on media reports, online databases, and other sources. This database is currently available at http://ojo-streamer.herokuapp.com/. The 5741 points in the GLC provide a foundation for evaluating spatial and temporal trends in landslide activity from 2007 to 2013. Globally, landslides were reported most frequently from July to September. Most events occurred in Asia, North America and Southeast Asia. In contrast, fewer than 5\% of the fatalities were reported in North America, suggesting a significant amount of under-reporting in other regions as well as potential discrepancies between developing and developed regions. Reported landslide events were also compared to satellite-based precipitation estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) to evaluate the co-occurrence of extreme precipitation and landslide activity. Of the 3550 points considered in a subset of the GLC, approximately 60\% of the reported landslides have daily precipitation exceeding the 95th percentile of precipitation calculated over a 14-year TRMM record for the same location. This study also investigated how the recurrence interval of extreme precipitation corresponded to some of the most catastrophic landslide events. In spite of several reporting and cataloging biases, spatial and temporal analysis of the GLC suggests that it is a valuable database for characterizing global patterns of landslide occurrence and evaluating relationships with extreme precipitation at regional and global scales.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric rivers accompanying Pacific storm systems play an important role in supplying moisture to the West Coast. Heavy precipitation associated with these systems falls not only along the west-facing slopes of the Coastal Range but also along the windward slopes of the interior Sierra Mountains. Simulations of the 29-31 December 2005 storm in northern California using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model were able to realistically resolve the structure and strength of the water vapor fluxes over ocean and land. The cross-barrier, southwesterly water vapor fluxes, peaking near 700 kg m-1 s-1 at the coast, dominated the airmass transformation over the northern California mountain complex. However, there was also significant northward water vapor flux along the base of the Sierras. The combination of a narrow, short-lived water vapor source from the atmospheric river, the gap in terrain facilitating flow around the coastal mountains, and the occurrence of a strong barrier jet at the base of the Sierras all contributed to the northward along-barrier water vapor fluxes within the storm. The coincident timing of the maximum water vapor flux into the central valley with the period when the barrier jet was well developed yielded up valley fluxes {\textgreater}300 kg m-1 s-1 for several hours. For the 29-31 December 2005 Pacific storm, the flow around the coastal terrain and up valley replenished about a quarter of the depleted water vapor lost over the coastal mountains. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {A new two-moment cloud microphysics scheme predicting the mixing ratios and number concentrations of five species (i.e., cloud droplets, cloud ice, snow, rain, and graupel) has been implemented into the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). This scheme is used to investigate the formation and evolution of trailing stratiform precipitation in an idealized two-dimensional squall line. Results are compared to those using a one-moment version of the scheme that predicts only the mixing ratios of the species, and diagnoses the number concentrations from the specified size distribution intercept parameter and predicted mixing ratio. The overall structure of the storm is similar using either the one- or two-moment schemes, although there are notable differences. The two-moment (2-M) scheme produces a widespread region of trailing stratiform precipitation within several hours of the storm formation. In contrast, there is negligible trailing stratiform precipitation using the one-moment (1-M) scheme. The primary reason for this difference are reduced rain evaporation rates in 2-M compared to 1-M in the trailing stratiform region, leading directly to greater rain mixing ratios and surface rainfall rates. Second, increased rain evaporation rates in 2-M compared to 1-M in the convective region at midlevels result in weaker convective updraft cells and increased midlevel detrainment and flux of positively buoyant air from the convective into the stratiform region. This flux is in turn associated with a stronger mesoscale updraft in the stratiform region and enhanced ice growth rates. The reduced (increased) rates of rain evaporation in the stratiform (convective) regions in 2-M are associated with differences in the predicted rain size distribution intercept parameter (which was specified as a constant in 1-M) between the two regions. This variability is consistent with surface disdrometer measurements in previous studies that show a rapid decrease of the rain intercept parameter during the transition from convective to stratiform rainfall. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

Although most ensemble members-initialized with realistic initial condition uncertainties smaller than the NCEP Global Forecast System Final Analysis (GFS FNL) using an ensemble Kalman filter-forecast broad areas of severe convection, there is a large variability of forecast performance among different members, highlighting the limit of practical predictability. In general, the best-performing members tend to have a stronger upperlevel trough and associated surface low, producing a more conducive environment for strong long-lived squall lines and bow echoes, once triggered. The divergence in development is a combination of a dislocation of the upper-level trough, surface low with corresponding marginal environmental differences between developing and nondeveloping members, and cold pool evolution by deep convection prior to squall line formation. To further explore the intrinsic predictability of the storm, a sequence of sensitivity experiments was performed with the initial condition differences decreased to nearly an order of magnitude smaller than typical analysis and observation errors. The ensemble forecast and additional sensitivity experiments demonstrate that this storm has a limited practical predictability, which may be further improved with more accurate initial conditions. However, it is possible that the true storm could be near the point of bifurcation, where predictability is intrinsically limited. The limits of both practical and intrinsic predictability highlight the need for probabilistic and ensemble forecasts for severe weather prediction.©2012 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Identifying mechanisms driving spatially heterogeneous glacial mass-balance patterns in the Himalaya, including the ‘Karakoram anomaly’, is crucial for understanding regional water resource trajectories. Streamflows dependent on glacial meltwater are strongly positively correlated with Karakoram summer air temperatures, which show recent anomalous cooling. We explain these temperature and streamflow anomalies through a circulation system—the Karakoram vortex—identified using a regional circulation metric that quantifies the relative position and intensity of the westerly jet. Winter temperature responses to this metric are homogeneous across South Asia, but the Karakoram summer response diverges from the rest of the Himalaya. We show that this is due to seasonal contraction of the Karakoram vortex through its interaction with the South Asian monsoon. We conclude that interannual variability in the Karakoram vortex, quantified by our circulation metric, explains the variability in energy-constrained ablation manifested in river flows across the Himalaya, with important implications for Himalayan glaciers’ futures. The mass balance of glaciers will influence regional water resources in the Himalayas. Changes in atmospheric dynamics, the Karakoram vortex contraction, and interaction with the monsoon influence the glacial melt of the region.},

	abstract = {Winter precipitation over the Hindu Kush-Karakoram (HKK) range in the western Himalayas is generated by westerly perturbations whose dynamics is affected by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Larger precipitation is typically recorded during the positive NAO phase. In this work, the relationship between the NAOand winter precipitation in theHKKis explored further, using an ensemble of precipitation datasets and the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) and Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) data. The mechanisms underlying this relationship are discussed, with a focus on the secular variations that occurred in the last century. The NAO exerts its control on HKK precipitation by altering the intensity of westerly winds in the region of the Middle East jet stream (MEJS). Results indicate that evaporation from the Persian Gulf, the northern Arabian Sea, and the Red Sea plays an important role. During positive NAO phases, westerlies are strengthened and enhanced evaporation occurs from these basins owing to higher surface wind speed. The extra moisture combines with stronger westerlies and results in enhanced moisture transport toward the HKK. Precipitation datasets covering the twentieth century show an alternation of periods of strong and weaker influence of theNAOon precipitation in the HKK. It is found that these variations are associated with changes in the spatial pattern of the NAO: the relative position of the two centers of action of the NAO determines to what extent it can modulate the MEJS, affecting precipitation in the HKK.},

	abstract = {Analysis of daily observations shows that wintertime (November-April) precipitation over Southwest Asia is modulated by Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) activity in the eastern Indian Ocean, with strength comparable to the interannual variability. Daily outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) for 1979-2001 is used to provide a long and consistent, but indirect, estimate of precipitation, and daily records from 13 stations in Afghanistan reporting at least 50\% of the time for 1979-85 are used to provide direct, but shorter and irregularly reported, precipitation data. In the station data, for the average of all available stations, there is a 23\% increase in daily precipitation relative to the mean when the phase of the MJO is negative (suppressed tropical convection in the eastern Indian Ocean), and a corresponding decrease when the MJO is positive. The distribution of extremes is also affected such that the 10 wettest days all occur during the negative MJO phase. The longer record of OLR data indicates that the effect of the MJO is quite consistent from year to year, with the anomalies averaged over Southwest Asia more negative (indicating more rain) for the negative phase of the MJO for each of the 22 yr in the record. Additionally, in 9 of the 22 yr the average influence of the MJO is larger than the interannual variability (e.g., the relationship results in anomalously wet periods even in dry years and vice versa). Examination of NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data shows that the MJO modifies both the local jet structure and, through changes to the thermodynamic balance, the vertical motion field over Southwest Asia, consistent with the observed modulation of the associated synoptic precipitation. A simple persistence scheme for forecasting the sign of the MJO suggests that the modulation of Southwest Asia precipitation may be predictable for 3-week periods. Finally, analysis of changes in storm evolution in Southwest Asia due to the influence of the MJO shows a large difference in strength as the storms move over Afghanistan, with apparent relevance for the flooding event of 12-13 April 2002. © 2005 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {The model of atmospheric rivers (ARs) has been around since the 1990s. A closely related model is the warm conveyor belt (WCB) developed in the 1970s. Looking further back in time, a phenomenon known as the “moist tongue” was intensively investigated in the late 1930s and early 1940s by Rossby and his collaborators using the innovation of isentropic analysis. This article aims to establish a historical perspective on the development of the moist tongue model and its relevance to the current models of WCBs and ARs. As it turns out, the moist tongue was identified as an extension of moist air into a region of lower moisture content on the selected isentropic charts. Most moist tongues are driven by large-scale cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies and are often accompanied by surface cold fronts in close proximity. Ahead of the moist tongues, areas of continuous precipitation are caused mainly by the motion of moist air up the steep isentropic slopes over warm fronts or topographical features. In the warm season, the mere presence of a moist tongue could be sufficient to give thunderstorms. A reanalysis dataset is used to reexamine the structures and evolutions of two moist tongue events in 1936. It is shown that not all but some of the moist tongues fit well with the modern conceptual models of WCB and AR. These two case studies also serve to elucidate the usefulness of reanalysis data for investigating historical high-impact weather events that were poorly understood due to the lack of observational data.},

UDSs were defined as times when snow levels rose more than 500 m and took place during midwinter increases in runoff. We explored the characteristics of these storms using atmospheric reanalysis products, surface weather and satellite observations. A prototypical case study is provided. With one exception, all UDSs coincided with midwinter peak runoff events resulting from the high snow levels (mean snow level 2.2 km msl) and extreme precipitation ({\textgreater}95 th percentile). All UDS cases occurred during the presence of one or more landfalling atmospheric rivers. The definition of UDSs should be expanded to include these key drivers of snow hydrological extremes (high snow levels, rain-on-snow, and extreme precipitation).},

Iran, in particular, was substantially affected by the floods. The nearly 9,000-km-long AR propagated across North Africa and the Middle East, and was fed by additional moisture from several other sources on its pathway. Simultaneous presence of a midlatitude system and a subtropical jet facilitated the moisture supply. The AR, as passing over the Zagros Mountains, produced record rainfall induced by the orographic forcing. The resulting floods caused widespread damage to infrastructures and left a death toll of at least 76 in Iran.},

Along the West Coast of North America, they occasionally cause considerable mayhem—delivering flooding rains during periods of heightened activity and desiccating droughts during periods of reduced activity. The intrinsic chaos of the atmosphere makes the prediction of atmospheric rivers at subseasonal-to-seasonal time scales (3 to 5 weeks) an inherently difficult task. We demonstrate here that the potential exists to advance forecast lead times of atmospheric rivers into subseasonal-to-seasonal time scales through knowledge of two of the atmosphere's most prominent oscillations, the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). Strong MJO and QBO activity modulates the frequency at which atmospheric rivers strike—offering an opportunity to improve subseasonal-to-seasonal forecast models and thereby skillfully predict atmospheric river activity up to 5 weeks in advance.},

	abstract = {One of the most robust signals of climate change is the relentless rise in global mean surface temperature, which is linked closely with the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere. A more humid atmosphere will lead to enhanced moisture transport due to, among other factors, an intensification of atmospheric rivers (ARs) activity, which are an important mechanism of moisture advection from subtropical to extra-tropical regions. Here we show an enhanced evapotranspiration rates in association with landfalling atmospheric river events. These anomalous moisture uptake (AMU) locations are identified on a global scale. The interannual variability of AMU displays a significant increase over the period 1980-2017, close to the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) scaling, at 7 \% per degree of surface temperature rise. These findings are consistent with an intensification of AR predicted by future projections. Our results also reveal generalized significant increases in AMU at the regional scale and an asymmetric supply of oceanic moisture, in which the maximum values are located over the region known as the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool (WHWP) centred on the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. Increasing atmospheric temperatures are expected to have various impacts on the global water cycle. Here, the authors show that there is an intensification of atmospheric rivers, that causes enhanced evapotranspiration and thus atmospheric moisture uptake in many regions of the world.},

	abstract = {The WFDE5 dataset has been generated using the WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) methodology applied to surface meteorological variables from the ERA5 reanalysis. The WFDEI dataset had previously been generated by applying the WFD methodology to ERA-Interim. The WFDE5 is provided at 0.5 spatial resolution but has higher temporal resolution (hourly) compared to WFDEI (3-hourly). It also has higher spatial variability since it was generated by aggregation of the higher-resolution ERA5 rather than by interpolation of the lower-resolution ERA-Interim data. Evaluation against meteorological observations at 13 globally distributed FLUXNET2015 sites shows that, on average, WFDE5 has lower mean absolute error and higher correlation than WFDEI for all variables. Bias-adjusted monthly precipitation totals of WFDE5 result in more plausible global hydrological water balance components when analysed in an uncalibrated hydrological model (WaterGAP) than with the use of raw ERA5 data for model forcing. The dataset, which can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.20d54e34 (C3S, 2020b), is distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) through its Climate Data Store (CDS, C3S, 2020a) and currently spans from the start of January 1979 to the end of 2018. The dataset has been produced using a number of CDS Toolbox applications, whose source code is available with the data - allowing users to regenerate part of the dataset or apply the same approach to other data. Future updates are expected spanning from 1950 to the most recent year. A sample of the complete dataset, which covers the whole of the year 2016, is accessible without registration to the CDS at https://doi.org/10.21957/935p-cj60 (Cucchi et al., 2020).},

This study investigates the relationship between ECs and ARs by exploring the connections between EC strength and AR intensity and position using a new AR intensity scale. While 82\% of ARs are associated with an EC, only 45\% of ECs have a paired AR and the distance between the AR and EC varies greatly. Roughly 20\% of ARs (defined by vertically integrated water vapor transport) occur without a nearby EC. These are usually close to a subtropical/tropical moisture source and include an anticyclone. AR intensity is only moderately proportional to EC strength. Neither the location nor intensity of an AR can be simply determined by an EC. Greater EC intensification occurs with stronger ARs, suggesting that ARs enhance EC deepening by providing more water vapor for latent heat release.},

	abstract = {The augmented Noah land surface model described in the first part of the two-part series was evaluated here over global river basins. Across various climate zones, global-scale tests can reveal a model's weaknesses and strengths that a local-scale testing cannot. In addition, global-scale tests are more challenging than local- and catchment-scale tests. Given constant model parameters (e. g., runoff parameters) across global river basins, global-scale tests are more stringent. We assessed model performance against various satellite and ground-based observations over global river basins through six experiments that mimic a transition from the original Noah LSM to the fully augmented version. The model shows transitional improvements in modeling runoff, soil moisture, snow, and skin temperature, despite considerable increase in computational time by the fully augmented Noah-MP version compared to the original Noah LSM. The dynamic vegetation model favorably captures seasonal and spatial variability of leaf area index and green vegetation fraction. We also conducted 36 ensemble experiments with 36 combinations of optional schemes for runoff, leaf dynamics, stomatal resistance, and the β factor. Runoff schemes play a dominant and different role in controlling soil moisture and its relationship with evapotranspiration compared to ecological processes such as β the factor, vegetation dynamics, and stomatal resistance. The 36-member ensemble mean of runoff performs better than any single member over the world's 50 largest river basins, suggesting a great potential of land-based ensemble simulations for climate prediction.

RMSE is inappropriate because it is a function of 3 characteristics of a set of errors, rather than of one (the average error). RMSE varies with the variability within the distribution of error magnitudes and with the square root of the number of errors (n1/2), as well as with the average-error magnitude (MAE). Our findings indicate that MAE is a more natural measure of average error, and (unlike RMSE) is unambiguous. Dimensioned evaluations and inter-comparisons of average model-performance error, therefore, should be based on MAE. © Inter-Research 2005.},

Here, using an atmospheric river detection algorithm along with a regional climate model and satellite observations, we show that the most intense atmospheric rivers induce extremes in temperature, surface melt, sea-ice disintegration, or large swells that destabilize the ice shelves with 40\% probability. This was observed during the collapses of the Larsen A and B ice shelves during the summers of 1995 and 2002 respectively. Overall, 60\% of calving events from 2000–2020 were triggered by atmospheric rivers. The loss of the buttressing effect from these ice shelves leads to further continental ice loss and subsequent sea-level rise. Under future warming projections, the Larsen C ice shelf will be at-risk from the same processes. The most intense atmospheric rivers to hit the Antarctic Peninsula induce extremes in temperature, surface melt, sea ice disintegration or swell that destabilize the ice shelves with 40\% probability, suggest analyses of observations and regional climate model simulations.},

	abstract = {Recent major melting events in West Antarctica have raised concerns about a potential hydrofracturing and ice shelf instability. These events often share common forcings of surface melt-like anomalous radiative fluxes, turbulent heat fluxes and föhn winds. Using an atmospheric river detection algorithm developed for Antarctica together with surface melt datasets, we produced a climatology of atmospheric river-related surface melting around Antarctica and show that atmospheric rivers are associated with a large percentage of these surface melt events. Despite their rarity (around 12 events per year in West Antarctica), atmospheric rivers are associated with around 40\% of the total summer meltwater generated across the Ross Ice Shelf to nearly 100\% in the higher elevation Marie Byrd Land and 40–80\% of the total winter meltwater generated on the Wilkins, Bach, George IV and Larsen B and C ice shelves. These events were all related to high-pressure blocking ridges that directed anomalous poleward moisture transport towards the continent. Major melt events in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet only occur about a couple times per decade, but a 1–2 °C warming and continued increase in atmospheric river activity could increase the melt frequency with consequences for ice shelf stability.},

S2S prediction fills the gap between short-range weather prediction and long-range seasonal outlooks. Decisions in a range of sectors are made in this extended-range lead time; therefore, there is a strong demand for this new generation of forecasts. International efforts are under way to identify key sources of predictability, improve forecast skill and operationalize aspects of S2S forecasts; however, challenges remain in advancing this new frontier. If S2S predictions are to be used effectively, it is important that, along with science advances, an effort is made to develop, communicate and apply these forecasts appropriately. In this study, the emerging operational S2S forecasts are presented to the wider weather and climate applications community by undertaking the first comprehensive review of sectoral applications of S2S predictions, including public health, disaster preparedness, water management, energy and agriculture. The value of applications-relevant S2S predictions is explored, and the opportunities and challenges facing their uptake are highlighted. It is shown how social sciences can be integrated with S2S development, from communication to decision-making and valuation of forecasts, to enhance the benefits of ‘climate services’ approaches for extended-range forecasting. While S2S forecasting is at a relatively early stage of development, it is concluded that it presents a significant new window of opportunity that can be explored for application-ready capabilities that could allow many sectors the opportunity to systematically plan on a new time horizon.},

It has been successfully and widely utilized. A new version (HAR v2) with longer temporal coverage and extended domains is currently under development. ERA5 reanalysis data is used as forcing data. This study aims to find the optimal set-up for the production of the HAR v2 to provide similar or even better accuracy as the HAR. First, we conducted a sensitivity study, in which different cumulus, microphysics, planetary boundary layer, and land surface model schemes were compared and validated against in situ observations. The technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) method was applied to identify the best schemes. Snow depth in ERA5 is overestimated in High Mountain Asia (HMA) and causes a cold bias in the WRF output. Therefore, we used Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55) to correct snow depth initialized from ERA5 based on the linear scaling approach. After applying the best schemes identified by the TOPSIS method and correcting the initial snow depth, the model performance improves. Finally, we applied the improved set-up for the HAR v2 and computed a one-year run for 2011. Compared to the HAR, the HAR v2 has a better representation of air temperature at 2 m. It produces slightly higher precipitation amounts, but the spatial distribution of seasonal mean precipitation is closer to observations.},

This paper briefly describes the S2S project in the context of extended range prediction of extreme events. We provide evidence that S2S forecasts have the potential to predict the onset, evolution and decay of some large-scale extreme events several weeks ahead. For instance, S2S models displayed skill to predict high probabilities of extreme 2-m temperature anomalies over Russia during the worst week of the 2010 Russian heat wave up to 3 weeks in advance. In other cases, like for tropical cyclone prediction, S2S models can produce useful information on the probability of the occurrence of tropical storms within sufficiently large areas through the prediction of large-scale predictors, such as the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO). In future, S2S forecasts of extreme events could be integrated into a “ready-set-go” framework between seasonal and medium range forecasts, by providing an early warning of an extreme event a few weeks in advance. Finally, S2S forecasts can also be used to investigate the causality of some extreme events and we show evidence that the cold March 2013 over western Europe and North Asia was linked to a MJO event propagating over the western Pacific.},

	abstract = {The near-surface zero degree line (ZDL) is a key isotherm in mountain regions worldwide, but a detailed analysis of methods for the ZDL determination, their properties and applicability in a changing climate is missing. We here test different approaches to determine the near-surface ZDL on a monthly scale in the Swiss Alps. A non-linear profile yields more robust and more realistic ZDLs than a linear profile throughout the year and especially in the winter-half year when frequent inversions disqualify a linear assumption. In the period 1871–2019, the Swiss ZDL has risen significantly in every calendar month: In northern Switzerland, the monthly ZDL increases generally amount to 300–400 m with smaller values in April and September (200–250 m) and a larger value in October (almost 500 m). The largest increases of 600–700 m but also very large uncertainties (±400 m, 95\% confidence interval) are found in December and January. The increases have accelerated in the last decades, especially in spring and summer. The ZDL is currently increasing by about 160 in the summer-half year and by up to 340 ± 45 m·°C–1 in winter months m per °C warming. In southern Switzerland, ZDL trends and temperature scalings are somewhat smaller, especially in winter. Sensitivity analyses using a simple shift of the non-linear temperature profile suggest that the winter ZDL-temperature scalings are at a record high today or will reach it in the near future, and are expected to decrease with a strong future warming. Nevertheless, the cumulative ZDL increase for strong warming is considerably larger in winter than in summer. Based on a few key criteria, we also present best practises to determine the ZDL in mountain regions worldwide. The outlined methods lay a foundation for the analysis of further isotherms and to study the future ZDL evolution based on climate scenario data.},

	abstract = {This study uses a unique combination of airborne and satellite observations to characterize narrow regions of strong horizontal water vapor flux associated with polar cold fronts that occurred over the eastern North Pacific Ocean during the winter of 1997/98. Observations of these ‘‘atmospheric rivers’’ are compared with past numerical modeling studies to confirm that such narrow features account for most of the instantaneous meridional water vapor transport at midlatitudes. Wind and water vapor profiles observed by dropsondes deployed on 25–26 January 1998 during the California Land-falling Jets Experiment (CALJET) were used to document the structure of a modest frontal system. The horizontal water vapor flux was focused at low altitudes in a narrow region ahead of the cold front where the combination of strong winds and large water vapor content were found as part of a low-level jet. A close correlation was found between these fluxes and the integrated water vapor (IWV) content. In this case, 75\% of the observed flux through a 1000-km cross-front baseline was within a 565-km-wide zone roughly 4 km deep. This zone contained 1.5 ? 108 kg s?1 of meridional water vapor flux, the equivalent of ?20\% of the global average at 35?N. By compositing polar-orbiting satellite Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) data from 46 dates con- taining long, narrow zones of large IWV, it was determined that the single detailed case was representative of the composite in terms of both the IWV amplitude (3.09 cm vs 2.81 cm) and the width of the area where IWV ? 2 cm (424 km vs 388 km). The SSM/I composites also showed that the width scales (defined by the 75\% cumulative fraction along a 1500-km cross-plume baseline) for cloud liquid water and rain rate were 176 and 141 km, respectively, which are narrower than the 417 km for IWV. Examination of coincident Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and SSM/I satellite data revealed that GOES cloud-top temperatures were coldest and cloud-top pressures were lowest in the core of the IWV plumes, and that the core cloud tops became substantially colder and deeper for larger IWV. A strong latitudinal dependence of the satellite-derived cross-river characteristics was also found. Atmospheric rivers form a critical link between weather and climate scales. They strongly influence both short-term weather and flood prediction, as well as seasonal climate anomalies and the global water cycle, through their cumulative effects. However, the rivers remain poorly observed by the existing global atmospheric observing system in terms of their horizontal water vapor fluxes},

This difference resulted from conditions present while the warm sector of the storm, with its associated low-level jet, high moisture content, and weak static stability, was overhead. Rainfall in the warm sector was dominated by orographic forcing. While the wind speed strongly modulated rain rates on windward slopes, the wind direction positioned the edge of a rain shadow cast by the Santa Lucia Mountains partially over the San Lorenzo basin, thus protecting the city of Santa Cruz from a more severe flood.

	abstract = {Imagine a stream of water thousands of kilometers long and as wide as the distance between New York City and Washington, D. C., flowing toward you at 30 miles per hour. No, this is not some hypothetical physics problem-it is a real river, carrying more water than 7-15 Mississippi Rivers combined. But it is not on land. It's a river of water vapor in the atmosphere. Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow corridors of water vapor transport in the lower atmosphere that traverse long swaths of the Earth's surface as they bind together the atmospheric water cycle (Figure 1). The characteristic (indeed defining) dimensions of these ARs are (1) integrated water vapor (IWV) concentrations such that if all the vapor in the atmospheric column were condensed into liquid water, the result would be a layer 2 or more centimeters thick; (2) wind speeds of greater than 12.5 meters per second in the lowest 2 kilometers; and (3) a shape that is long and narrow, no more than 400-500 kilometers wide, and extending for thousands of kilometers, sometimes across entire ocean basins. Research during the past decade has documented the importance of ARs to the overall workings of the midlatitude global water cycle. Moreover, their presence and characteristics are at the root of the most extreme precipitation and flooding in areas where these features encounter mountains. At the same time, ARs make important contributions to how much snow and water will be available in these regions. Thus, understanding their behavior may be the key to determining how changing climate patterns influence extreme precipitation and floods. Overall , the need to understand ARs opens up a new set of grand challenges for water cycle, water supply, and flood prediction science. Observations of Atmospheric Rivers Zhu and Newell [1998] helped coin the term "atmospheric river" based on its narrow ness and importance to the water cycle. They found that at any given time, an average of more than 90\% of the total pole-ward atmospheric water vapor transport through the middle latitudes is concentrated in four to five narrow regions that total less than 10\% of the circumference of the Earth at that latitude. These features are generally located in the warm sectors of midlati-tude cyclones, ahead of cold fronts. They continually form, move, and evolve with storms in the midlatitude storm tracks, sometimes drawing tropical water vapor and heat directly into the middle latitudes [e.g., Stohl et al., 2008; Ralph et al., 2011]. Since the seminal work of Zhu and Newell [1998], the prevalence and role of ARs in the water cycle and in continental weather have become ever more clear, partly because of the advent of microwave remote sensing from polar-orbiting satellites, especially the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), which provides frequent global measurements of IWV over the Earth's oceans, measurements that previously were available above only the relatively few sites where weather balloons and related instruments were deployed. The imager works very well over oceans and, since its spatiotemporal coverage became adequate in about 1998, has focused growing attention on ARs (see Figure 1a) in ways that previous water vapor data could not. In the years since then, a growing number of field experiments and related studies have A Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) satellite image from 13-14 October showing the AR hitting the California coast; color bar shows, in centimeters, the amount of water vapor present throughout the air column at any given point if all the water vapor were condensed into one layer of liquid (vertically integrated water vapor). (b) Rain gage data for 12:00 UTC on 14 Octo-ber 2009 showing the total amount of precipitation (in inches) that occurred over the previous 24 hours. (c) Discharge for Nacimiento River (site indicated by red triangles in other panels); data are from U.S. Geological Survey stream gage 11148900.

During the winter, the thunderstorms were typically embedded in cold fronts associated with eastward-propagating extratropical cyclones. Summer thunderstorms were triggered by cold upper-level lows associated with the tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT). Concurrent lightning and satellite data associated with the storms were averaged over 0.5° × 0.5° grid cells and a detection efficiency correction model was applied to quantify the lightning rates. The results of the data analysis show a consistent logarithmic increase in convective rainfall rate with increasing lightning rates. Moreover, other storm characteristics such as radar reflectivity, storm height, ice water path, and latent heat show a similar logarithmic increase. Specifically, the reflectivity in the mixed-phase region increased significantly with lightning rate and the lapse rate of Z decreased; both of these features are well-known indicators of the robustness of the cloud electrification process. In addition, the height of the echo tops showed a strong logarithmic correlation with lightning rate. These results have application over data-sparse ocean regions by allowing lightning-rate data to be used as a proxy for related storm properties, which can be assimilated into NWP models. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = { Using station and gridded datasets, we compare global precipitation and temperature trends by elevation  Local comparisons of paired stations and regional comparisons using gridded data often show faster mountain than lowland warming  Precipitation differences between mountains and adjacent lowlands are reducing, often driven by stronger precipitation increase in lowlands Abstract Quantifying rates of climate change in mountain regions is of considerable interest, not least because mountains are viewed as climate "hotspots" where change can anticipate or amplify what is occurring elsewhere. Accelerating mountain climate change has extensive environmental impacts, including depletion of snow/ice reserves, critical for the world's water supply. Whilst the concept of elevation-dependent warming (EDW), whereby warming rates are stratified by elevation, is widely accepted, no consistent EDW profile at the global scale has been identified. Past assessments have also neglected elevation-dependent changes in precipitation. In this comprehensive analysis, both in situ station temperature and precipitation data from mountain regions, and global gridded datasets (observations, reanalyses and model hindcasts) are employed to examine the elevation dependency of temperature and precipitation changes since 1900. In situ observations in paired studies (using adjacent stations) show a tendency towards enhanced warming at higher elevations. However, when all mountain/lowland studies are pooled into two groups, no systematic difference in high vs. low elevation group warming rates is found. Precipitation changes based on station data are inconsistent with no systematic contrast between mountain and lowland precipitation trends. Gridded datasets (CRU, GISTEMP, GPCC, ERA5, CMIP5) show increased warming rates at higher elevations in some regions, but on a global scale there is no universal amplification of warming in mountains. Increases in mountain precipitation are weaker than for low elevations worldwide, meaning reduced elevation-dependency of precipitation, especially in mid-latitudes. Agreement on elevation-dependent changes between gridded datasets is weak for temperature but stronger for precipitation. Plain language summary Mountains cover a large part of the Earth's surface and harbor distinct ecosystems, hold most of snow and ice outside the polar regions, and provide water for billions of people. This research looks at recent climate changes in mountains and compares them with simultaneous changes in lowland regions using weather station data, large global datasets, and climate models. We examine changes since 1900, but also concentrate on the last 40 years since this is when many changes have started to accelerate. Nearly all regions of the globe are getting warmer. When we make local comparisons, mountain sites are usually warming faster than lower areas nearby. However, when we average data from all global mountains and compare them with those from all lowland areas, there is no significant difference. Rainfall/snowfall on the other hand is decreasing in some areas, and increasing in others. In nearly all cases the strongest increase is occurring in the lowland areas, with increases in the mountains being more subdued (if at all). One consequence of our findings is that stores of mountain snow and ice may decline even faster than previously assumed due to the Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright.

The annual cycle of EA AR exhibits eight stages, synchronizing with the seasonal-to-subseasonal variation of precipitation and their associated atmospheric steering. Particularly, extension of the western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH) to south China sea, due to the springtime east-west thermal contrast, steers ARs over Southeast China (SEC), inducing spring precipitation. During the Asian summer monsoon season, the spatial variation of the AR main route echoes the northward displacement of WNPSH, coincides with the prevailing monsoonal wind onset and stepwise propagation of rain belt. The warm moisture-laden air of the wintertime ARs confronts the dry and cold air over SEC, contributing to the winter precipitation. ARs offer substantial potential predictability of (heavy) precipitation days over the midlatitude from the late spring to early summer, and over SEC and south Japan from late winter to early spring.},

The global SCC numbers estimated by Ricke et al. are therefore approximately ten times larger than those produced by the US government using existing IAMs 4. Whether the effect of temperature on GDP truly persists over many years-and if so, whether the relationship between GDP and short-term fluctuations in weather applies to long-term changes in climate-are still open questions with important implications for the SCC. To model the effects of a pulse of CO 2 emissions on country-level temperatures, the authors use an innovative approach that combines results from several climate model experiments to capture the magnitude and geographic pattern of warming under different representative concentration pathways (RCPs), and the carbon cycle and climate system responses. Incorporating our current knowledge of the climate system, as represented in Earth system models, into the SCC is an important step forwards. Current IAMs use very simple one-region radiative balance models and two-or three-box carbon cycle models, which may miss critical dynamics and feedbacks, and do not represent geographic heterogeneity. The loose coupling between the socioeconomic and climate systems in the framework used by Ricke et al. mean that it cannot be used for certain applications, such as balancing costs and benefits to calculate an optimal CO 2 emissions path. However, the benefits in terms of more closely tying SCC estimates (and uncertainties) to current understanding of the climate system are substantial.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs), which are narrow water vapor transport bands over the mid-latitudes, often have great socio-economic impacts over East Asia. Although summertime AR activity over East Asia is strongly induced by preceding-winter El Niño development, the extent to which seasonal transitions of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) from winter to summer affect the AR activity remains unclear. Here, we examine the relationship between the seasonal transitions of ENSO and the summertime AR activity over East Asia using an atmospheric reanalysis and high-resolution atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) ensemble simulations. A rapid transition from preceding-winter El Niño to summertime La Niña results in more AR occurrence over northern East Asia via the northward expansion of an anomalous low-level anticyclone over the western North Pacific compared with sustained or decayed El Niño cases. The northward expansion of the anticyclone is consistent with a steady response of the atmosphere to the anomalous condensation heating over the Maritime Continent and equatorial Pacific. Meridional positions of the extratropical AR occurrence and circulation anomalies are different between the reanalysis and AGCM simulations, which is possibly contributed by a limited sample size and/or AGCM biases and suggests that the seasonal prediction of AR-related natural disaster risk over East Asia on a regional scale remains a challenge.},

	abstract = {The climatology of atmospheric rivers (ARs) and their roles on precipitation extremes have been extensively researched over western North America and Europe, yet ARs in Asia, especially for those affecting the densely populated countries including Bangladesh, China, India, Thailand and Vietnam are not adequately understood. Here, the climatological characteristics of landfalling ARs, including their frequency and intensity, in the Asian monsoon region for the period 1979–2017 are investigated using the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset. The inter-annual variability of landfalling ARs associated with the combination of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is presented. The results suggest frequent AR activities over southern India, Indochina Peninsula, southern China, Korea and Japan from May to September. ARs are found to contribute up to 44\% of the total summer precipitation over the coastal regions of East Asia and up to 36\% in South Asia. Also, ARs are associated with up to 68\% of the summer extreme precipitation amount in East Asia and 52–56\% in South Asia. The connection between ARs and extreme precipitation is partly explained by the increased precipitation efficiency when ARs occur, indicating a stronger ability of the atmospheric dynamical factors to deplete moisture and generate strong precipitation. The analyses of the combined ENSO–QBO effects on ARs show that ARs in the subtropics tend to become less frequent in the years preceded by an El Niño event due to the weakening of the low-level monsoonal flows associated with the weakened land–sea thermal contrast and upper-level tropical easterly jet, and such modulations tend to become more significant under the easterly phase of QBO.},

	abstract = {Twentieth century trends of precipitation are examined by a variety of methods to more fully describe how precipitation has changed or varied. Since 1910, precipitation has increased by about 10\% across the contiguous United States. The increase in precipitation is reflected primarily in the heavy and extreme daily precipitation events. For example, over half (53\%) of the total increase of precipitation is due to positive trends in the upper 10 percentiles of the precipitation distribution. These trends are highly significant, both practically and statistically. The increase has arisen for two reasons. First, an increase in the frequency of days with precipitation [6 days (100 yr)(-1)] has occurred for all categories of precipitation amount. Second, for the extremely heavy precipitation events, an increase in the intensity of the events is also significantly contributing (about half) to the precipitation increase. As a result, there is a significant trend in much of the United States of the highest daily year-month precipitation amount, but with no systematic national trend of the median precipitation amount. These data suggest that the precipitation regimes in the United States are changing disproportionately across the precipitation distribution. The proportion of total precipitation derived from extreme and heavy events is increasing relative to more moderate events. These changes have an impact on the area of the United States affected by a much above-normal (upper 10 percentile) proportion of precipitation derived from very heavy precipitation events, for example, daily precipitation events exceeding 50.8 mm (2 in.).},

	abstract = {An East Asian cold surge (EACS) is characterized by rapid advancement of a polar airmass toward the east coast of the Eurasian continent in boreal winter. Over the east coast of Asia, extratropical cyclogenesis and the amplitudes of atmospheric disturbances ranging from synoptic to subseasonal timescales are immediately enhanced as the cold air approaches. This study investigates for the first time the impact of these EACS-excited disturbances on the activity of atmospheric rivers (ARs) over the North Pacific. Applying a new AR detection algorithm to the NASA MERRA dataset, we show that the daily occurrence probability of ARs over the eastern North Pacific near the west coast of U.S. is effectively modulated by EACS. In particular, this downstream dynamical modulation goes through two distinct stages: during the period Day 0-3, where Day 0 corresponds to the time of the peak intensity of an EACS event, high-frequency (HF, {\textless}6-day) baroclinic disturbances developed over the western North Pacific and Gulf of Alaska lead to significant poleward moisture transport over these two regions, and during the period Day 4-6, intermediate-low frequency (IF-LF, {\textgreater}12-day) barotropic disturbances developed from the merging of high-frequency troughs increase the daily occurrence probability of ARs near the west coast of the U.S. by 50\%, relative to the climatological value. The results reported here demonstrate the critical role of IF and LF disturbances in establishing the link between the predictability of EACS and that of the AR-related extreme precipitation events in the western U.S. in boreal winter. © 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

For each water tower, we assess its vulnerability related to water stress, governance, hydropolitical tension and future climatic and socio-economic changes. We conclude that the most important (highest WTI) water towers are also among the most vulnerable, and that climatic and socio-economic changes will affect them profoundly. This could negatively impact 1.9 billion people living in (0.3 billion) or directly downstream of (1.6 billion) mountainous areas.

	abstract = {In the Upper Indus Basin (UIB), precipitation associated with synoptic-scale circulations impinges on the complex and steep orography of the western Himalaya and Karakoram. Heavy rainfall often falls over the foothills, frequently triggering landslides there. This study explores the role of these synoptic-scale circulations – extratropical western disturbances (WDs) and tropical depressions (TDs) – in producing the conducive conditions necessary to trigger landslides, using data from the NASA Global Landslide Catalog and WD and TD track databases. During the winter (October to April), UIB landslides peak in February and occur at a rate of 0.05 day−1, 61\% of which are associated with the passage of a WD. They are most common when a WD is located within a few hundred kilometres of 30°N, and significantly rarer if the WD is north of 40°N. WDs provide moist southwesterly flow from the Arabian Sea and Mediterranean Sea to the UIB, resulting in large-scale precipitation, but landslide probability is not related to WD intensity. Non-WD winter landslides are associated with small-scale orographic precipitation that we hypothesise is due to cloudbursts. During the summer (May to September), UIB landslides peak in August and occur at a rate of 0.11 day−1, 60\% of which are associated with TD activity. Many of these TDs are found over central India, slightly south of the climatological monsoon trough, where they provide strong monsoonal southeasterlies to the UIB flowing along the Himalayas. Increased landslide frequency is also associated with TD activity over the southern Bay of Bengal (BoB), and it is hypothesised that this is related to monsoon break conditions. Landslide frequency is significantly correlated with TD intensity. Non-TD landslides are associated with a northwestward extension of the monsoon trough, providing southeasterly barrier flow to the UIB. Implications for forecasting and climate change are discussed.},

In the tropical Pacific these winters are characterized by enhanced activity on intraseasonal (roughly 20–60 day) timescales and by relatively small sea surface temperature anomalies compared to ENSO winters. For these winters, lagged composites are used to document a coherent relationship between the location of extreme precipitation events along the West Coast and the location of enhanced tropical convection on intraseasonal timescales.

An analysis of Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 atmospheric reanalysis data and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System radiative flux data reveals that a record warm and moist Arctic atmosphere supported the reduced sea ice growth. Numerous regional episodes of increased atmospheric temperature and moisture, transported from lower latitudes, increased the cumulative energy input from downwelling longwave surface fluxes. In those same episodes, the efficiency of the atmosphere cooling radiatively to space was reduced, increasing the amount of energy retained in the Arctic atmosphere and reradiated back toward the surface. Overall, the Arctic radiative cooling efficiency shows a decreasing trend since 2000. The results presented highlight the increasing importance of atmospheric forcing on sea ice variability demonstrating that episodic Arctic atmospheric rivers, regions of elevated poleward water vapor transport, and the subsequent surface energy budget response is a critical mechanism actively contributing to the evolution of Arctic sea ice.},

The “AR Recon” program was established to improve forecasts of landfalling Pacific-coast ARs and their associated precipitation. Dropsondes are deployed from weather reconnaissance aircraft and pressure sensors have been added to drifting ocean buoys to fill a major gap in standard weather observations, while research is being conducted on the potential for airborne Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (ARO) to also contribute to forecast improvement. ARO further expands the spatial coverage of the data collected during AR Recon flights. This study provides the first description of these data, which provide water vapor and temperature information typically as far as 300 km to the side of the aircraft. The first refractivity profiles from European Galileo satellites are provided and their accuracy is evaluated using the dropsondes. It is shown that spatial variations in the refractivity anomaly (difference from the climatological background) are modulated by AR features, including the low-level jet and tropopause fold, illustrating the potential for RO measurements to represent key AR characteristics. It is demonstrated that assimilation of ARO refractivity profiles can influence the moisture used as initial conditions in a high-resolution model. While the dropsonde measurements provide precise, in situ wind, temperature and water vapor vertical profiles beneath the aircraft, and the buoys provide surface pressure, ARO provides complementary thermodynamic information aloft in broad areas not otherwise sampled at no additional expendable cost.},

Analysis of all winter ARs in California during water years 1998-2011 indicates more ARs occur during the negative phase of AO and PNA, with the increase between positive and negative phases being ∼90\% for AO, and ∼50\% for PNA. The circulation pattern associated with concurrent negative phases of AO and PNA, characterized by cyclonic anomalies centered northwest of California, provides a favorable dynamical condition for ARs. The analysis suggests that the massive Sierra Nevada snowpack during the 2010/2011 winter season is primarily related to anomalously high frequency of ARs favored by the joint phasing of -AO and -PNA, and that a secondary contribution is from increased snow accumulation during these ARs favored by colder air temperatures associated with -AO, -PNA, and La Niña. Key Points The anomalously snowy winter season of 2010/11 in the Sierra Nevada is analyzed. An exceptionally large number of atmospheric rivers occurred during the season. The increased AR occurrence is attributed to the joint phasing of AO and PNA. ©2013. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Near-surface warming in the Arctic has been almost twice as large as the global average over recent decades-a phenomenon that is known as the 'Arctic amplification'. The underlying causes of this temperature amplification remain uncertain. The reduction in snow and ice cover that has occurred over recent decades may have played a role. Climate model experiments indicate that when global temperature rises, Arctic snow and ice cover retreats, causing excessive polar warming. Reduction of the snow and ice cover causes albedo changes, and increased refreezing of sea ice during the cold season and decreases in sea-ice thickness both increase heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere. Changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation, as well as cloud cover, have also been proposed to cause Arctic temperature amplification. Here we examine the vertical structure of temperature change in the Arctic during the late twentieth century using reanalysis data. We find evidence for temperature amplification well above the surface. Snow and ice feedbacks cannot be the main cause of the warming aloft during the greater part of the year, because these feedbacks are expected to primarily affect temperatures in the lowermost part of the atmosphere, resulting in a pattern of warming that we only observe in spring. A significant proportion of the observed temperature amplification must therefore be explained by mechanisms that induce warming above the lowermost part of the atmosphere. We regress the Arctic temperature field on the atmospheric energy transport into the Arctic and find that, in the summer half-year, a significant proportion of the vertical structure of warming can be explained by changes in this variable. We conclude that changes in atmospheric heat transport may be an important cause of the recent Arctic temperature amplification.},

	abstract = {In this study, the connection between Arctic Oscillation (AO) and variability of East Asian winter monsoon is investigated. Two indices are chosen to describe the winter monsoon. One is the intensity of the Siberian High, defined as the average SLP over the center region, and the other is the temperature of eastern China, averaged over 76 surface stations. These are two tightly related components, correlate at -0.62 for period 1951-99. Temperature drops by 0.64 degrees Celsius in association with a one standard deviation increase in Siberian High intensity. It is found that there are significant out-of-phase relationships between the AO and the East Asian winter monsoon. The correlation coefficient between the AO and the Siberian High intensity index is -0.48 for period 1958-98. AO is also significantly correlated with the temperature of eastern China at 0.34. However, when the linear trend is removed, the correlation between AO and temperature is no longer significant. But the strong connection between the AO and Siberian High, and between the Siberian High and temperature are still significant. These results reveal that the AO influences the East Asian winter monsoon through the impact on the Siberian High. Negative phase of the AO is concurrent with a stronger East Asian Trough and an anomalous anticyclonic flow over Urals at the middle troposphere (500hPa). Both the AO and the Eurasian pattern play important roles in changes of the Siberian High and/or East Asian winter monsoon. They account for 13.0\% and 36.0\% of the variance in the Siberian High respectively.},

	abstract = {Persistent atmospheric ridging events centered near the western United States are associated with widespread precipitation deficits and meteorological drought. Due to the relatively low skill of dynamical models in forecasting precipitation on subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) time scales across this region, forecasts of ridging are explored in this study as a potential bridge for early warning drought prediction. To assess skill, we evaluate deterministic and probabilistic S2S hindcasts (out to 6 week lead time) of ridging events and geopotential height anomalies over the western United States in five ensemble hindcast systems. Prediction skill for ridging events is shown to be highly variable across models. For some models, longer-time-averaged patterns of geopotential height anomalies across the first 6 weeks can be skillfully simulated, when evaluated probabilistically against climatology. The most skillful models show modest skill in forecasting above normal ridging occurrences at lead times of Weeks 3–4 and Weeks 5–6, with some sensitivity to the specific ridge location and method for determining skill. Using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model as a case study, longer lead time forecast busts are shown to often occur under extended periods of highly active La Nina-like tropical convection. Model errors at simulating these tropical convection features may have a disproportionately large impact and degrade downstream forecasts over the western United States. Despite the documented model shortcomings, our results highlight an opportunity to target skillful ridging forecasts from dynamical models for improving early warning drought forecasting at S2S lead times.},

We consider satellite rainfall estimates (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission), reanalyses (ERA-Interim), gridded in situ rain gauge data (Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources, Climate Research Unit, and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre), and a merged satellite and rain gauge climatology (Global Precipitation Climatology Project). The data are compared with simulation results from the global climate model EC-Earth. All data sets, despite having different resolutions, coherently reproduce the mean annual cycle of precipitation in the western and eastern stretches of the HKKH. While for the Himalaya only a strong summer precipitation signal is present, associated with the monsoon, the data indicate that the Hindu-Kush Karakoram, which is exposed to midlatitude "western weather patterns", receives water inputs in winter. Time series of seasonal precipitation confirm that the various data sets provide a consistent measurement of interannual variability for the HKKH. The longest observational data sets indicate a statistically significant decreasing trend in Himalaya during summer. None of the data sets gives statistically significant precipitation trends in Hindu-Kush Karakoram during winter. Precipitation data from EC-Earth are in good agreement with the climatology of the observations (rainfall distribution and seasonality). The evolution of precipitation under two different future scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) reveals an increasing trend over the Himalaya during summer, associated with an increase in wet extremes and daily intensity and a decrease in the number of rainy days. Unlike the observations, the model shows an increasing precipitation trend also in the period 1950-2009, possibly as a result of the poor representation of aerosols in this type of GCMs. Key Points Precipitation Hydrological cycle Himalaya EC-Earth. © 2012 American Geophysical Union.

	abstract = {The Indian winter (December-February) monsoon (IWM) contributes almost one third of the annual precipitation over the western Himalayas (WH). In winter, eastward moving synoptic weather systems, or "western disturbances" (WDs), yield precipitation in either liquid or solid form. Although previous studies have examined the interannual variation (IAV) of the IWM, little is known of the intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) associated with the IWM. The present study examines the ISO and its plausible effects on the IWM using 28 years (1980-2007) of precipitation, height, wind, and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) fields. The dominant ISO mode is found during the active IWM phase with well-defined cyclonic circulation in the midtroposphere over the WH. The relationship between OLR and circulation indicates that this ISO mode is driven by moisture convergence. During the peak phase, a strong moisture influx from the Arabian Sea dominates. This moisture incursion adds to the precipitation over the WH. Successive growth and decay of anomalous cyclonic and anticyclonic circulation takes place within ISO periodicity. Strong convection always seems to precede anomalous cyclonic circulation. In addition, in-phase wind and convection (over the WH region) are associated with the ISO phase.

We investigate AR signatures in the atmospheric vertical profiles at the Dronning Maud Land coast, East Antarctica, using regular and extra radiosonde measurements conducted during the Year of Polar Prediction Special Observing Period November 2018 to February 2019. Prominent AR events affecting the locations of Neumayer and Syowa cause a strong increase in specific humidity extending through the mid-troposphere and a strong low-level jet (LLJ). At Neumayer, the peak in the moisture inversion (up to 4 g kg−1) is observed between 800 and 900 hPa, while the LLJ (up to 32 m s−1) is concentrated below 900 hPa. At Syowa the increase in humidity is less pronounced and peaks near the surface, while there is a substantial increase in wind speed (up to 40 m s−1) between 825 and 925 hPa. Moisture transport (MT) within the vertical profile during the ARs attains a maximum of 100 g kg−1 m s−1 at both locations, and is captured by both ERA-Interim and ERA5 reanalysis data at Neumayer, but is strongly underestimated at Syowa. Composites of the enhanced MT events during 2009-19 show that these events represent an extreme state of the lower-tropospheric profile compared to its median values with respect to temperature, humidity, wind speed and, consequently, MT. High temporal- and vertical-resolution radiosonde observations are important for understanding the contribution of these rare events to the total MT towards Antarctica and improving their representation in models.},

The results show that areas that provide the anomalous uptake of moisture can be categorized into four regions: (1) the South Atlantic Ocean between 10°S and 30°S, (2) a clear local maximum in the eastern South Atlantic, (3) a continental source of anomalous uptake to the north of the Western Cape, and (4) over South America at a distance of more than 7000 km from the target region. It emerges that the South American moisture source can be linked to a particular phase of the South American low-level jet, known as a no Chaco jet event (NCJE), which transports moisture to the western and central South Atlantic basin. Concisely, we provide strong evidence that the two margins of the South Atlantic Ocean appear connected by two meteorological structures, with the NCJE playing a key role of transporting moisture from South America to the western and central South Atlantic basin, feeding the AR that transports some of the moisture to the west coast of South Africa.},

	abstract = {Following the launch of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory, two advanced high resolution multi-satellite precipitation products namely, Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) version 6 are released. A critical evaluation of these newly released precipitation data sets is very important for both the end users and data developers. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of IMERG research product and GSMaP estimates over India at a daily scale for the southwest monsoon season (June to September 2014). The GPM-based precipitation products are inter-compared with widely used TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), and gauge-based observations over India. Results show that the IMERG estimates represent the mean monsoon rainfall and its variability more realistically than the gauge-adjusted TMPA and GSMaP data. However, GSMaP has relatively smaller root-mean-square error than IMERG and TMPA, especially over the low mean rainfall regimes and along the west coast of India. An entropy-based approach is employed to evaluate the distributions of the selected precipitation products. The results indicate that the distribution of precipitation in IMERG and GSMaP has been improved markedly, especially for low precipitation rates. IMERG shows a clear improvement in missed and false precipitation bias over India. However, all the three satellite-based rainfall estimates show exceptionally smaller correlation coefficient, larger RMSE, larger negative total bias and hit bias over the northeast India where precipitation is dominated by orographic effects. Similarly, the three satellite-based estimates show larger false precipitation over the southeast peninsular India which is a rain-shadow region. The categorical verification confirms that these satellite-based rainfall estimates have difficulties in detection of rain over the southeast peninsula and northeast India. These preliminary results need to be confirmed in other monsoon seasons in future studies when the fully GPM-based IMERG retrospectively processed data prior to 2014 are available.},

This accumulated snow melts during ablation period. In the context of today's warming atmosphere, it is imperative to study the changes in the temperature and precipitation patterns over the WH to assess the impact of global warming on climatic conditions of the region. Keeping that in mind, observational analysis of temperature and precipitation fields is planned. In the present study various climatic indices are analyzed based on wintertime (DJF) data of 30 years (1975-2006) obtained from the Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE), India. Results indicate enhancement in the surface air temperature across the WH. Percent number of warm (cold) days have increased (decreased) during 1975-2006 over the WH.

	abstract = {Western disturbances (WDs) are upper-level synoptic-scale systems embedded in the subtropical westerly jet stream (STWJ), often associated with extreme rainfall events in north India and Pakistan during boreal winter. Here, a tracking algorithm is applied to the upper-tropospheric vorticity field for 37 years of ERA-Interim reanalysis data, giving a catalogue of over 3000 events. These events are analysed in a composite framework: the vertical structure is explored across a large number of dynamic and thermodynamic fields, revealing a significant northwestward tilt with height, strong ascent ahead of the centre, which sits above the maximum surface precipitation, and a warm-over-cold, dry-over-moist structure, among other signatures of strong baroclinicity. Evolution of the structures of cloud cover and vertical wind speed are investigated as the composite WD passes across northern India. Cloud cover in particular is found to be particularly sensitive to the presence of the Himalayan foothills, with a significant maximum at 300 hPa approximately 1 day after the WD reaches peak intensity. k-means clustering is used to classify WDs according to both dynamical structure and precipitation footprint and the relationship between the two sets of WDs is explored. Finally, the statistical relationship between the STWJ position and WDs on interannual time-scales is explored, showing that WD frequency in north India is highly sensitive to the jet location over Eurasia. Years with a greater number of WDs feature a STWJ shifted to the south, a pattern that is substantially more coherent and reaches as far west as North America during boreal winter. This suggests that it may be possible to predict the statistics of western disturbance events on seasonal time-scales if suitable indicators of jet position can also be predicted.},

Using surface stations, a vertical wind profiler, and a multi-physics ensemble approach, we found that most of the wind speed biases are controlled by the roughness length z0, and so by the choice of LSM. While timing characteristics of Sundowners are insensitive to both LSM and PBL schemes, a clear sensitivity in the horizontal extent of strong surface winds is found for both PBL parameterization and z0, which are related to patterns of self-induced wave-breaking near the mountaintop, and the erosion of the marine layer. These results suggest that LSMs with relatively high values of z0, and TKE-based or hybrid PBL schemes adequately simulate downslope windstorms in the lee of mountain ranges, specifically in areas where downslope windstorms interact with the marine boundary layer with stably stratified characteristics.},

In this work, regional precipitation patterns over the western United States and linkages to ENSO and the PDO are analyzed using output from a Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) preindustrial control run and observations, with emphasis on extreme precipitation events. CCSM4 produces realistic zonal gradients in precipitation intensity and duration over the western United States, with higher values on the windward side of the Cascade Mountains and Sierra Nevada and lower values on the leeward. Compared to its predecessor CCSM3, CCSM4 shows an improved teleconnected signal of both ENSO and the PDO to large-scale circulation patterns over the Pacific-North America region and also to the spatial pattern and other aspects of westernU.S. precipitation. The so-called drizzle problempersists inCCSM4 but is significantly improved compared to CCSM3. In particular, it is found that CCSM4 has substantially less precipitation duration bias than is present in CCSM3. Both the overall and extreme intensity of wintertime precipitation over the western United States show statistically significant linkages with ENSO and PDO in CCSM4.

	abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow and elongated regions of enhanced horizontal water vapour transport. Considerable research on understanding Northern Hemisphere ARs and their relationship with extreme precipitation has shown that ARs have a strong association with heavy rainfall and flooding. While there has been very little work on ARs in the Southern Hemisphere, global climatologies suggest that ARs are equally as common in both hemispheres. New Zealand in particular is located in a region of high AR frequency. This study aims to test the hypothesis that ARs play a significant role in heavy precipitation and flooding events in New Zealand. We used a recently developed AR identification method and daily station data across New Zealand to test for the concurrence of ARs and extreme rainfall. We found that, at each of the eleven stations analysed, at least seven to all ten of the top ten heaviest precipitation days between 1980 and 2018 were associated with AR conditions. Nine of the ten most damaging floods in New Zealand between 2007 and 2017 occurred during AR events. These results have important implications for understanding extreme rainfall in New Zealand, and ultimately for predicting some of the most hazardous events in the region. This work also highlights that more research on ARs in New Zealand is needed.},

This made possible an analysis of the meteorological variables in a coordinate system fixed with respect to the jet stream axis at 200 mb. Monthly mean maps and vertical cross sections of wind, temperature, moisture and mass distribution were computed in this coordinate system. The jet-stream core is situated close to the 200-mb surface and has a maximum speed close to 70 m per sec in the mean integrated around the world; this is mainly due to very high speeds over Africa and Asia. Mean velocities close to or above 160 kn are found in the ridges of the meandering jet axis, and lower speeds are observed in the troughs.

	abstract = {Mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has accelerated over the past two decades, coincident with rapid Arctic warming and increasing moisture transport over Greenland by atmospheric rivers (ARs). Summer ARs affecting western Greenland trigger GrIS melt events, but the physical mechanisms through which ARs induce melt are not well understood. This study elucidates the coupled surface-atmosphere processes by which ARs force GrIS melt through analysis of the surface energy balance (SEB), cloud properties, and local- to synoptic-scale atmospheric conditions during strong summer AR events affecting western Greenland. ARs are identified in MERRA-2 reanalysis (1980-2017) and classified by integrated water vapor transport (IVT) intensity. SEB, cloud, and atmospheric data from regional climate model, observational, reanalysis, and satellite-based datasets are used to analyze melt-inducing physical processes during strong,.90th percentile ''AR901'' events. Near AR ''landfall,'' AR901 days feature increased cloud cover that reduces net shortwave radiation and increases net longwave radiation. As these oppositely signed radiative anomalies partly cancel during AR901 events, increased melt energy in the ablation zone is primarily provided by turbulent heat fluxes, particularly sensible heat flux. These turbulent heat fluxes are driven by enhanced barrier winds generated by a stronger synoptic pressure gradient combined with an enhanced local temperature contrast between cool over-ice air and the anomalously warm surrounding atmosphere. During AR901 events in northwest Greenland, anomalous melt is forced remotely through a clear-sky foehn regime produced by downslope flow in eastern Greenland.},

This study describes statistical forecast models of intraseasonal variations. Twenty-four years of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and zonal components of the wind at 200 (U200) and 850 hPa (U850) are used. The models use the principal components (PCs) of combined EOF analysis of 20-90-day anomalies of OLR, U200, and U850 data. Forecast models are developed for each lead time from 1 to 10 pentads and for winter and summer seasons separately. The forecast models use a combination of the five most recent pentad values of the first five PCs of the combined EOF of (OLR, U200, U850) to predict the future values of a given PCK (k = 1, 5). The spatial structures are obtained by reconstructing the fields of OLR, U200, and U850 using the forecasts of PCK (k = 1, 5) and the associated EOFs. Verification with independent winter and summer data indicates useful forecasts of the first five PCs extending up to five pentads of lead time. The verification against 20-90-day anomalies indicates useful forecasts of the reconstructed fields of OLR, U200, and U850 extending up to four pentads of lead time over most of the Tropics. Furthermore, the statistical models provide useful forecasts of U200 and U850 intraseasonal anomalies up to two to three pentads of lead times in portions of the North Pacific region. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.},

These slow-moving, quasi-barotropic systems influence vertical stability and sustain a moist environment, giving them the potential to produce or affect sustained precipitation episodes along the west coast of the United States. They can remain motionless or change direction and speed more than once and thus often pose difficult forecast challenges. This study creates an objective climatological description of 500-hPa closed lows to assess their impacts on precipitation in the western United States and to explore interannual variability and preferred tracks. Geopotential height at 500 hPa from the NCEPNCAR global reanalysis dataset was used at 6-h and 2.5DG OE 2.5DG resolution for the period 1948-2011. Closed lows displayed seasonality and preferential durations. Time series for seasonal and annual event counts were found to exhibit strong interannual variability. Composites of the tracks of landfalling closed lows revealed preferential tracks as the features move inland over the western United States. Correlations of seasonal event totals for closed lows with ENSO indices, the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), and the PacificNorth American (PNA) pattern suggested an above-average number of events during the warm phase of ENSO and positive PDO and PNA phases. Precipitation at 30 U.S. Cooperative Observer stations was attributed to closed-low events, suggesting 20\%-60\% of annual precipitation along the West Coast may be associated with closed lows.},

See "IMERG Quality Index" document (https://pmm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/document\_files/IMERG\_QI.pdf) for a summary of these new fields. • Continue the practice of thresholding GPROF (now V05) precipitation rates for all input precipitation estimates to adjust fractional coverage; all GPROF estimates are currently thresholded at 0.03 mm/hour. • Continue the practice started with Version 04 of calibrating 2BCMB to GPCP V2.3 over ocean (at middle and high latitudes) and land (globally) to compensate for low (high) 2BCMB bias over non-tropical oceans (land). • The Version 05 GPROF estimates for MHS and ATMS do not provide estimates for the 5 and 8 footprints (respectively) at each swath edge for the period starting at the beginning of the GPM era (12 March 2014). This is due to algorithm issues as revealed in early testing. • The Version 05 GPROF-TMI estimates had not been computed for the GPM era when the IMERG Runs were retrospectively processed, so TMI is not presently included in the V05 IMERG datasets.},

	abstract = {Because of the scarcity of meteorological observations, the precipitation climate on the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding regions (TP) has been insufficiently documented so far. In this study, the characteristics and basic features of precipitation on the TP during an 11-yr period (2001-11) are described on monthly-to-annual time scales. For this purpose, a new high-resolution atmospheric dataset is analyzed, the High Asia Reanalysis (HAR), generated by dynamical downscaling of global analysis data using theWeatherResearch and Forecasting (WRF) model. The HAR precipitation data at 30- and 10-km resolutions are compared with both rain gauge observations and satellite-based precipitation estimates from theTropicalRainfall MeasurementMission (TRMM). It is found that the HAR reproduces previously reported spatial patterns and seasonality of precipitation and that the highresolution data add value regarding snowfall retrieval, precipitation frequency, and orographic precipitation. It is demonstrated that this process-based approach, despite some unavoidable shortcomings, can improve the understanding of the processes that lead to precipitation on the TP.Analysis focuses on precipitation amounts, type, seasonality, and interannual variability. Special attention is given to the links between the observed patterns and regional atmospheric circulation. As an example of an application of the HAR, a new classification of glaciers on the TP according to their accumulation regimes is proposed, which illustrates the strong spatial variability of precipitation seasonality. Finally, directions for future research are identified based on the HAR, which has the potential to be a useful dataset for climate, glaciological, and hydrological impact studies. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are channels of high water vapor flux that transport moisture from low to higher latitudes on synoptic timescales. In areas of topographical variability, ARs may lead to high-intensity precipitation due to orographic forcing. ARs landfalling along North America’s west coast are linked to extreme events including those leading to flooding and landslides. In southern California (SCA), proper AR forecasting is important for regional water resources as well as hazard mitigation and as the area’s annual precipitation totals occur from relatively few storms per season, any changes to storm frequency and/or intensity may have dramatic consequences. Yet, as most regional AR studies focus on the Pacific Northwest, there is little information about SCA ARs. We develop an algorithm to identify ARs landfalling on North America’s west coast between 1979 and 2013 within total precipitable water reanalysis fields. ARs are then categorized according to landfall region. To determine and differentiate the characteristics and spatial distributions of ARs affecting these areas, we examine lag composites of various atmospheric variables for each landfall region. SCA ARs differ from ARs landfalling farther north in the days prior to landfall with the position and amplitude of a trough offshore from the Asian continent and ridge over Alaska, as well as the displacement and eastward extension of the jet core that potentially guides AR moisture southwards. The relationships between AR landfalls and the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), and the Pacific/North American Teleconnection Pattern (PNA) are also investigated.},

	abstract = {Extremely high precipitation occurs in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, associated with both orographic enhancement and synoptic-scale weather processes. In this study, we test the hypothesis that atmospheric rivers (ARs) are a key driver of floods in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. Vertically integrated water vapour and horizontal water vapour transport, and atmospheric circulation, are investigated concurrently with major floods on the Waitaki River (a major South Island river). Analysis of the largest eight winter maximum floods between 1979 and 2012 indicates that all are associated with ARs. Geopotential height fields reveal that these ARs are located in slow eastward moving extratropical cyclones, with high pressure to the northeast of New Zealand. The confirmation of ARs as a contributor to Waitaki flooding indicates the need for their further exploration to better understand South Island hydrometeorological extremes.

	abstract = {The atmospheric river (AR) frequency trends over the Southern Hemisphere are investigated using three reanalyses and two Community Earth System Model (CESM) ensembles. The results show that AR frequency has been increasing over the Southern Ocean and decreasing over lower latitudes in the past four decades and that ARs have been shifting poleward. While the observed trends are mostly driven by the poleward shift of the westerly jet, fully coupled CESM experiments indicate anthropogenic forcing would result in positive AR frequency trends over the Southern Ocean due mostly to moisture changes. The difference between the observed trends and anthropogenically driven trends can be largely reconciled by the atmosphere-only CESM simulations forced by observed sea surface temperatures: Sea surface temperature variability characteristic of the negative phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation strongly suppresses the moisture-driven trends while enhances the circulation-induced trends over the Southern Ocean, thus bringing the simulated trends into closer agreement with the observed trends.},

	abstract = {Sundowner winds are a type of downslope windstorms observed on the southern slopes of the Santa Ynez Mountains (SYM) in Santa Barbara, southern California. The name “Sundowner” is due to the onset of strong winds near sunset. Sundowner winds can reach gale force and are extremely dangerous during wildfires. This study presents a climatology of Sundowners based on a 30 yr high spatiotemporal resolution dataset obtained with the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Combined empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of hourly zonal and meridional winds (10 m) with 1 km grid spacing is performed to characterize the diurnal variability of surface winds. The first two eigenmodes (EOF-1, EOF-2) (58\% of total variance) characterize the variability of surface winds in the western and eastern parts of the SYM, respectively. The hourly percentiles of the frequency distribution of the first two time coefficients (PC1, PC2) are used to identify three types of Sundowner regimes. The western (eastern) regime occurs when surface winds project strongly on EOF-1 (EOF-2) but not on EOF-2 (EOF-1). The western regime is characterized by a strong coastal jet around Point Conception with northwesterly winds extending into the Santa Barbara Channel. In contrast, a weak coastal jet not extending into the Santa Barbara Channel is observed in the eastern regime. In the Santa Barbara (SBA) regime, hourly surface winds project strongly on both EOF-1 and EOF-2. The western regime occurs more frequently than the eastern and SBA regimes and peaks during March-May. The eastern regime has maximum in January-February, whereas the SBA regime has a seasonal cycle similar to the western regime. Horizontal and vertical structures of winds and potential temperature show that the lee slope jet and mountain wave activity on the SYM exhibit strong spatial variations in the three regimes.},

	abstract = {Statistical relationships between atmospheric rivers (ARs) and extratropical cyclones and anticyclones are investigated on a global scale using objectively identified ARs, cyclones, and anticyclones during 1979–2014. Composites of circulation and moisture fields around the ARs show that a strong cyclone is located poleward and westward of the AR centroid, which confirms the close link between the AR and extratropical cyclone. In addition, a pronounced anticyclone is found to be located equatorward and eastward of the AR, whose presence together with the cyclone leads to strong horizontal pressure gradient that forces moisture to be transported along a narrow corridor within the warm sector of the cyclone. This anticyclone located toward the downstream equatorward side of the cyclone is found to be missing for cyclones not associated with ARs. These key features are robust in composites performed in different hemispheres, over different ocean basins, and with respect to different AR intensities. Furthermore, correlation analysis shows that the AR intensity is much better correlated with the pressure gradient between the cyclone and anticyclone than with the cyclone/ anticyclone intensity alone, although stronger cyclones favor the occurrence of AR. The importance of the horizontal pressure gradient in the formation of the AR is also consistent with the fact that climatologically ARs are frequently found over the region between the polar lows and subtropical highs in all seasons.},

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua snow cover daily L3 Global 500-m grid products (MOD10A1 and MYD10A1), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) daily Northern Hemisphere snow cover product and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer – Earth Observing System Daily Snow Water Equivalent were validated against Thematic Mapper (TM) snow cover maps of Landsat-5 and meteorological station snow depth observations. The overall accuracy of MOD10A1, MYD10A1 and IMS is higher than 91\% against stations observations and than 79\% against Landsat TM images. In general, the daily MODIS snow cover products show better performance than the multisensor IMS product. However, the IMS snow cover product is suitable for larger scale ({\textasciitilde}4km) analysis and applications, with the advantage over MODIS to allow for mitigation for cloud cover. The accuracy of the three products decreases with decreasing snow depth. Overestimation errors are most common over forested regions; the IMS and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer – Earth Observing System Snow Water Equivalent products also show poorer performance that the MODIS products over grassland. By identifying weaknesses in the satellite products, this study provides a focus for the improvement of snow products over the Tibetan plateau. The quantitative evaluation of the products proposed here can also be used to assess their relative weight in data assimilation, against other data sources, such as modelling and in situ measurement networks.

Spatial resolution differences have relatively minor effects on the number of ARs diagnosed, with higher-resolution data sets identifying four more AR days per year, on average, during the 1985–2015 winters. However, this can lead to {\textasciitilde}10\% difference in AR attribution to the mean domain-wide seasonal CS and differences up to 47\% snowfall attribution at the seasonal scale.

	abstract = {The name 'atmospheric river' (AR) could easily be misinterpreted to mean rivers flowing in the sky. But, ARs actually refer to narrow bands of strong horizontal water vapour transport that are concentrated in the lower troposphere. These bands are called 'atmospheric rivers' because the water vapour flux they carry is close to the volume of water carried by big river systems on the ground. ARs can cause heavy rainfall events if some physical mechanisms, such as orographic enhancement, exist to set up the moisture convergence and vertical motions necessary to produce condensation. In recent decades, these significant moisture plumes have attracted increasing attention from scientific communities, especially in North America and western Europe, to further understand the connections between ARs and extreme precipitation events which can trigger severe natural disasters such as floods, mudslides and avalanches. Yet very limited research has been conducted in the Australia-Asian (A-A) region, where the important role of atmospheric moisture transport has long been recognised for its rainfall generation and variations. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative project between the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and China Meteorological Administration, which was set up to explore the detailed AR characteristics of atmospheric moisture transport embedded in the A-A monsoon system. The project in China focused on using AR analysis to explore connections between moisture transport and extreme rainfall mainly during the boreal summer monsoon season. In Australia, AR analysis was used to understand the connections between the river-like Northwest Cloud Band and rainfall in the region. Results from this project demonstrate the potential benefits of applying AR analysis to better understand the role of tropical moisture transport in rainfall generation in the extratropics, thus achieve better rainfall forecast skills at NWP (Numerical Weather Prediction), sub-seasonal and seasonal time scales. We also discuss future directions of this collaborative research, including further assessing potential changes in ARs under global warming.},

Over 500 in situ rain gauges constitute an unprecedentedly dense rain gauge network over this region and provide an exceptional resource for ground validation of satellite rainfall estimates. Our evaluation centers on the rainy season from May to October in 2014. Results indicate that (1) GPM product outperforms TRMM at all spatial scales and elevation ranges in detecting daily rainfall accumulation; (2) rainfall accumulation over the entire rainy season is negatively correlated with mean elevation for rain gauges and the two satellite rainfall products, while the performance of TRMM also significantly correlates with topographic variations; (3) in terms of the ability of rainfall detection, false alarming ratio of TRMM (21\%) is larger than that of GPM (14\%), while missing ratio of GPM (13\%) is larger than that of TRMM (9\%). GPM tends to underestimate the amount of light rain events of 0–1 mm/d, while the opposite (overestimation) is true for TRMM. GPM shows better detecting ability for light rainfall (0–5 mm/d) events but there is no detection skill for both GPM and TRMM at high-elevation ({\textgreater}4500 m) regions. Our results not only highlight the superiority of GPM to TRMM in southern Tibetan Plateau region but also recommend that further improvement on the rainfall retrieval algorithm is needed by considering topographical influences for both GPM and TRMM rainfall products.},

	abstract = {Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) mass loss has accelerated since the turn of the twenty-first century. Several recent episodes of rapid GrIS ablation coincided with intense moisture transport over Greenland by atmospheric rivers (ARs), suggesting that these events influence the evolution of GrIS surface mass balance (SMB). ARs likely provide melt energy through several physical mechanisms, and conversely, may increase SMB through enhanced snow accumulation. In this study, we compile a long-term (1980–2016) record of moisture transport events using a conventional AR identification algorithm as well as a self-organizing map classification applied to MERRA-2 data. We then analyze AR effects on the GrIS using melt data from passive microwave satellite observations and regional climate model output. Results show that anomalously strong moisture transport by ARs clearly contributed to increased GrIS mass loss in recent years. AR activity over Greenland was above normal throughout the 2000s and early 2010s, and recent melting seasons with above-average GrIS melt feature positive moisture transport anomalies over Greenland. Analysis of individual AR impacts shows a pronounced increase in GrIS surface melt after strong AR events. AR effects on SMB are more complex, as strong summer ARs cause sharp SMB losses in the ablation zone that exceed moderate SMB gains induced by ARs in the accumulation zone during summer and in all areas during other seasons. Our results demonstrate the influence of the strongest ARs in controlling GrIS SMB, and we conclude that projections of future GrIS SMB should accurately capture these rare ephemeral events.},

An automated atmospheric river (AR) detection technique (ARDT) is applied to construct a climatology (1979-2019) of extreme mid-latitude moisture fluxes conducive to extreme precipitation. A distinct seasonality exists in AR occurrence aligning with seasonal variations in the mid-latitude jet streams. The formation of the Southern Hemisphere winter split jet enablesARoccurrence to persist through all seasons in northern regions of New Zealand, while southern regions of the country exhibit a substantial (50\%) reduction in AR occurrence as the polar jet shifts southward during the cold season. ARs making landfall on the western coast of New Zealand (90\% of all events) are characterised by a dominant north-westerly moisture flux associated with a distinct dipole pressure anomaly; low pressure to the south-west and high pressure to the north-east of New Zealand. Precipitation totals during AR events increases with AR rank (five-point scale) throughout the country, with the most substantial increase on the windward side of the Southern Alps (South Island), with the largest events (rank 5 ARs) producing 3-day precipitation totals exceeding 1000 mm. ARs account for up to 78\% of total precipitation and up to 94\% of extreme precipitation on the West Coast of the South Island. Assessment of the multi-scale atmospheric processes associated with AR events governing extreme precipitation in the Southern Alps of New Zealand should remain a priority given their hydrological significance and impact on people and infrastructure.},

However, the remote location, complex terrain and multi-country fabric of high-mountain Asia have made it difficult to maintain longer-term monitoring systems of the meteorological components that may have influenced glacial change. Here we compare a set of high-resolution climate model simulations from 1861 to 2100 with the latest available observations to focus on the distinct seasonal cycles and resulting climate change signatures of Asia's high-mountain ranges.We find that the Karakoram seasonal cycle is dominated by non-monsoonal winter precipitation, which uniquely protects it from reductions in annual snowfall under climate warming over the twenty-first century. The simulations show that climate change signals are detectable only with long and continuous records, and at specific elevations.

	abstract = {This paper analyses the spatial and temporal variability of winter droughts in a semi-arid geographic gradient in Northeast Spain, from the Pyrenees in the north to the Mediterranean coastland in the south. Droughts that occurred between 1952 and 1999 were analysed by means of the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). The influence of the weather-type frequency and of the general North Atlantic atmospheric circulation patterns was analysed. The results indicate that winter droughts show an important spatial variability in the study area, differentiating three well-defined patterns. These correspond to the Pyrenees, the centre of the Ebro Valley, and the Mediterranean coastland. General negative trends in winter SPI have been found, which are indicative of the increase in winter drought conditions in the study area. Nevertheless, important spatial differences have also been recorded. Dominant north–south gradients in the influence of weather types are shown. Moreover, the negative trends in winter-SPI values agree with the negative trend in the frequency of the weather types prone to cause precipitation, such as the C, SW and W weather types and the increase in the frequency of A weather types. Nevertheless, in the Mediterranean coastland, the positive trend in SPI values agrees with the increase in the frequency of weather types of the east (E, SE), which are prone to cause precipitation in this area. Interannual variations in the frequency of the different weather types have been highly determined by different general atmospheric circulation patterns, mainly the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Nevertheless, the correlation between the time series of weather-type frequency and the winter SPI is higher than that found between the SPI and the NAO. Thus, although the interannual NAO variability explains a high percentage of the interannual differences in the frequency of different weather types, it is not sufficient to explain the spatial and temporal variability of droughts, which respond better to atmospheric variability at more detailed (synoptic) spatial scales.},

This work investigates upper troposphere – lower stratosphere (UTLS) thermodynamics, specifically double tropopause events, and identifies lower stratospheric hydration related to deep convection. Results show that lower stratospheric hydration occurred during two organized convective types, a mesoscale convective complex (MCC) and squall line, which coincided with strong low level jet moisture transport. However, the lower stratosphere was not hydrated during discrete cells. While UTLS moisture was present in all three convective types, during the discrete cell, ice and water vapor were mixed, inhibiting net positive buoyancy and the transport of tropospheric material aloft. During the MCC and squall line events, UTLS moisture was stratified.

In addition, the MJO is also related to dynamic and thermodynamic variability near the surface and the upper ocean. This study uses observational data to characterize the changes in surface heat fluxes and sea surface temperature (SST) during the life cycle of the MJO. Variations in convective activity are described with outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) during the period January 1985 through September 1994. International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project data (January 1985-April 1991) and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts surface analyses (January 1985-December 1994) are used to derive surface fluxes of net shortwave radiation (SW) latent heat (E), their difference (Q = SW - E), and SST. The spatial patterns of OLR, SW, E, Q and SST anomalies reveal that the region of positive OLR anomalies that precede the occurrence of enhanced convection is associated with positive SW and negative E anomalies, which result in positive Q anomalies. The prevailing conditions in the region of positive Q anomalies favor the development of positive SST anomalies, which lead to variations of enhanced convection. In contrast the region of negative OLR anomalies is associated with negative SW and positive E anomalies. These conditions induce negative Q anomalies, which favor the formation of negative SST anomalies. The above results suggest a possible feedback between the oscillation and intraseasonal variations in SST and this may be an important mechanism for numerical simulations of the life cycle of the MJO.},

	doi = {10.5194/HESS-18-2265-2014},
	abstract = {A rain-on-snow flood occurred in the Bernese Alps, Switzerland, on 10 October 2011, and caused significant damage. As the flood peak was unpredicted by the flood forecast system, questions were raised concerning the causes and the predictability of the event. Here, we aimed to reconstruct the anatomy of this rain-on-snow flood in the Lötschen Valley (160 km2) by analyzing meteorological data from the synoptic to the local scale and by reproducing the flood peak with the hydrological model WaSiM-ETH (Water Flow and Balance Simulation Model). This in order to gain process understanding and to evaluate the predictability. The atmospheric drivers of this rain-on-snow flood were (i) sustained snowfall followed by (ii) the passage of an atmospheric river bringing warm and moist air towards the Alps. As a result, intensive rainfall (average of 100 mm day-1) was accompanied by a temperature increase that shifted the 0° line from 1500 to 3200 m a.s.l. (meters above sea level) in 24 h with a maximum increase of 9 K in 9 h. The south-facing slope of the valley received significantly more precipitation than the north-facing slope, leading to flooding only in tributaries along the south-facing slope. We hypothesized that the reason for this very local rainfall distribution was a cavity circulation combined with a seeder-feeder-cloud system enhancing local rainfall and snowmelt along the south-facing slope. By applying and considerably recalibrating the standard hydrological model setup, we proved that both latent and sensible heat fluxes were needed to reconstruct the snow cover dynamic, and that locally high-precipitation sums (160 mm in 12 h) were required to produce the estimated flood peak. However, to reproduce the rapid runoff responses during the event, we conceptually represent likely lateral flow dynamics within the snow cover causing the model to react "oversensitively" to meltwater. Driving the optimized model with COSMO (Consortium for Small-scale Modeling)-2 forecast data, we still failed to simulate the flood because COSMO-2 forecast data underestimated both the local precipitation peak and the temperature increase. Thus we conclude that this rain-on-snow flood was, in general, predictable, but requires a special hydrological model setup and extensive and locally precise meteorological input data. Although, this data quality may not be achieved with forecast data, an additional model with a specific rain-on-snow configuration can provide useful information when rain-on-snow events are likely to occur. © 2014 Author(s).},

Liquid water surfaces tend to affect the quality of TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis more significantly than ice water surfaces due to different passive microwave (MW) emission characteristics.

TRMM-based precipitation estimates are much higher than GPM products over inland water bodies, which is, however, not the case over the land.

To better understand the present-day characteristics of AR-related precipitation extremes, a selection of nine most intense historical AR events during 1980–2017 is simulated using a dynamical downscaling modeling framework based on the Weather Research and Forecasting Model. We find that the chosen framework and Weather Research and Forecasting Model configuration reproduces both large-scale atmospheric features—including parent synoptic-scale cyclones—as well as the filamentary corridors of integrated vapor transport associated with the ARs themselves. The accuracy of simulated extreme precipitation maxima, relative to in situ and interpolated gridded observations, improves notably with increasing model resolution, with improvements as large as 40–60\% for fine scale (3 km) relative to coarse-scale (27 km) simulations. A separate set of simulations using smoothed topography suggests that much of these gains stem from the improved representation of complex terrain. Additionally, using the 12 December 1995 storm in Northern California as an example, we demonstrate that only the highest-resolution simulations resolve important fine-scale features—such as localized orographically forced vertical motion and powerful near hurricane-force boundary layer winds. Given the demonstrated ability of a targeted dynamical downscaling framework to capture both local extreme precipitation and key fine-scale characteristics of the most intense ARs in the historical record, we argue that such a configuration may be highly conducive to understanding AR-related extremes and associated changes in a warming climate.},

In coastal areas we find often a transition of the SBL to a convective boundary layer (CBL) over polynyas, which allows for near-ideal studies of internal boundary layers. The sea ice areas in polar regions are another example for natural laboratory conditions, since they represent large areas with well-defined heterogeneities of two surface types.

The RASS and the ceilometer add information on the moisture structure of the boundary layer that is not detected by the SODAR. On the other hand this comparison validates known techniques by which the MLH is derived from SODAR data. Especially the temperature information from the RASS agrees well with lifted inversions derived from the analysis of the SODAR data.

We use this metric to create a climatological catalog of “wet” and “windy” ARs along the U.S. West Coast from 1980 to 2016. Windy ARs are generally associated with stronger surface winds than are wet ARs, with the largest differences at low IVT. Windy ARs are also associated with greater daily precipitation totals than are wet ARs, with the difference widening at higher IVT, notably over mountainous regions. Pacific Northwest ARs have become increasingly moisture dominated over 1980–2016, which has important implications for western U.S. water availability and flood risk.},

A 4-yr record of NASA A-Train cloud observations is combined with surface radiation measurements to quantify the WAIS radiation budget and constrain the three-dimensional occurrence frequency, thermodynamic phase partitioning, and surface radiative effect of clouds over West Antarctica (WA). The skill of satellite-modeled radiative fluxes is confirmed through evaluation against measurements at four Antarctic sites (WAIS Divide ice camp and Neumayer, Syowa, and Concordia stations). Owing to perennial high-albedo snow and ice cover, cloud infrared emission dominates over cloud solar reflection and absorption leading to a positive net all-wave cloud radiative effect (CRE) at the surface, with all monthly means and 99.15\% of instantaneous CRE values exceeding zero. The annual-mean CRE at the WAIS surface is 34 W m-2, representing a significant cloud-induced warming of the ice sheet. Low-level liquid-containing clouds, including thin liquid water clouds implicated in radiative contributions to surface melting, are widespread and most frequent in WA during the austral summer. In summer, clouds warm the WAIS by 26 W m-2, on average, despite maximum offsetting shortwave CRE. Glaciated cloud systems are strongly linked to orographic forcing, with maximum incidence on the WAIS continuing downstream along the Transantarctic Mountains.},

The Northern Hemisphere circulation and precipitation associated with intraseasonal and seasonal-to-interannual components of the leading pattern of Indian Ocean convection are investigated for November-April 1979-2008. The leading pattern of Indian Ocean convection is separated into intraseasonal and seasonal-to-interannual components by filtering an index of outgoing longwave radiation at 33-105 days and greater than 105 days, yielding Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO)- and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-influenced patterns, respectively. Observations and barotropic Rossby wave ray tracing experiments suggest that Indian Ocean convection can influence the ENSO-related hemispheric teleconnection pattern in addition to the regional Asian teleconnection. Equivalent barotropic circulation anomalies throughout the Northern Hemisphere subtropics are associated with both seasonal-to-interannual Indian Ocean convection and ENSO. The hemispheric teleconnection associated with seasonal-to-interannual Indian Ocean convection is investigated with ray tracing, which suggests that forcing over the Indian Ocean can propagate eastward across the hemisphere and back to Asia. The relationship between the seasonal-to-interannual component of Indian Ocean convection and ENSO is investigated in terms of a gradient in sea surface temperatures (SST) over the equatorial western Pacific Ocean. When the western Pacific SST gradient is strong during ENSO, strong Maritime Continent precipitation extends further westward into the Indian Ocean, which is accompanied by enhanced tropospheric Asian circulation, similar to the seasonal-to-interannual component of Indian Ocean convection. Analysis of the three strongest interannual convection seasons shows that the strong Indian Ocean pattern of ENSO can dominate individual seasons. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

The ENSO is anti-correlated with Indian summer monsoon (ISM). While, the Indian north-east monsoon, and the north and central India winter precipitation (NCIWP) are correlated with ENSO. Previous studies have shown that the strength of the ISM-ENSO teleconnection is quite dependent on the zonal position of the El Nino warming. Similarly, in this study it has been found that, the NCIWP depends upon the warming of the eastern Pacific (EP) El Nino rather than the central Pacific (CP) El Nino. The EP El Nino warms the western Indian Ocean during the winter season which intensifies the Hadley cell with its subsidence over central India. The sinking motion over central India shifts and intensifies the sub-tropical westerly jet (SWJ) over northern India. The SWJ intensifies the frequent surges in mid-latitude, called western disturbances (WDs) which, results in excess precipitation over the north and central India. Also, the subsidence over central India leads to lower level cyclonic circulation over central Indian landmass, which converges winds from warm Arabian Sea to north India supplying with abundant moisture for the WDs. © 2013.},

	abstract = {Marine ecosystems are undergoing rapid change at local and global scales. To understand these changes, including the relative roles of natural variability and anthropogenic effects, and to predict the future state of marine ecosystems requires quantitative understanding of the physics, biogeochemistry and ecology of oceanic systems at mechanistic levels. Central to this understanding is the role played by dominant patterns or "modes" of atmospheric and oceanic variability, which orchestrate coherent variations in climate over large regions with profound impacts on ecosystems. We review the spatial structure of extratropical climate variability over the Northern Hemisphere and, specifically, focus on modes of climate variability over the extratropical North Atlantic. A leading pattern of weather and climate variability over the Northern Hemisphere is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO refers to a redistribution of atmospheric mass between the Arctic and the subtropical Atlantic, and swings from one phase to another producing large changes in surface air temperature, winds, storminess and precipitation over the Atlantic as well as the adjacent continents. The NAO also affects the ocean through changes in heat content, gyre circulations, mixed layer depth, salinity, high latitude deep water formation and sea ice cover. Thus, indices of the NAO have become widely used to document and understand how this mode of variability alters the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. There is no unique way, however, to define the NAO. Several approaches are discussed including both linear (e.g., principal component analysis) and nonlinear (e.g., cluster analysis) techniques. The former, which have been most widely used, assume preferred atmospheric circulation states come in pairs, in which anomalies of opposite polarity have the same spatial structure. In contrast, nonlinear techniques search for recurrent patterns of a specific amplitude and sign. They reveal, for instance, spatial asymmetries between different phases of the NAO that are likely important for ecological studies. It also follows that there is no universally accepted index to describe the temporal evolution of the NAO. Several of the most common measures are presented and compared. All reveal that there is no preferred time scale of variability for the NAO: large changes occur from one winter to the next and from one decade to the next. There is also a large amount of within-season variability in the patterns of atmospheric circulation of the North Atlantic, so that most winters cannot be characterized solely by a canonical NAO structure. A better understanding of how the NAO responds to external forcing, including sea surface temperature changes in the tropics, stratospheric influences, and increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, is crucial to the current debate on climate variability and change. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

What is not to love? Climate change, drought, flammable vegetation, and naturally prevailing weather conditions make a significant portion of the population vulnerable in many ways. Earthquakes and tsunamis might come to mind, but perhaps more of a threat is fire and/or flooding at, on or near the wildland-urban interface. The recent Thomas fire in December of 2017 and subsequent flooding, debris flow and mudslides in Montecito that followed in January of 2018 highlight what coastal vulnerability means under the new normal of extreme wildfire and flooding danger for this region. This paper discusses the unique hazards along with local weather conditions that contribute to vulnerability. We then detail spatial analytics to assess, model and predict risks.

Warming and drying in this region have both occurred in recent decades, but the associated meteorological factors are difficult to diagnose based on observations from unevenly distributed weather stations, reanalyses, and global climate models that poorly reproduce the orographic diurnal cycle. Here, recent trends in the summer diurnal cycle over the central Himalaya are investigated using a 36-year high-resolution dynamical downscaling. We illustrate contrasting trends over the diurnal cycle of circulation and convection over the Himalaya. In the daytime, warming of the slopes has enhanced anabatic upslope winds. At night, clearer skies have radiatively cooled the slopes, enhancing katabatic downslope winds. The enhanced upslope winds have prevented any drying over the mountains in the daytime, while the enhanced downslope winds are associated with significant nocturnal drying at high elevations. This amplification in the diurnal cycle is critical for projecting the future hydroclimate over the region’s complex terrain.},

	abstract = {The Arctic frontal zone (AFZ) is a narrow band of strong horizontal temperature gradients that develops along the Arctic Ocean coastline each summer in response to differential heating of the atmosphere over adjacent land and ocean surfaces. Past research has linked baroclinicity within the AFZ to summer Arctic cyclone development, especially by intensifying storms that migrate northward from the Eurasian continent. This study uses the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble in conjunction with an advanced cyclone detection and tracking algorithm to assess how the AFZ, summer Arctic cyclone activity, and the relationship between them respond to warming under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario. Under this strong warming scenario, the AFZ remains a significant cyclone intensifier. Changes to the AFZ are largely restricted to June, when earlier snowmelt leads to strengthening of land-ocean temperature contrasts. This strengthening is accompanied by enhanced cyclogenesis along the east Siberian coast, but no change is observed for overall cyclone frequency over the Arctic Ocean. However, simultaneous changes to subpolar storm tracks impact Arctic cyclone activity in all summer months, sometimes in opposition to the impact of the AFZ. In June, the storms migrating poleward to the Arctic Ocean become weaker under RCP8.5, leading to lower Arctic cyclone intensity. In July and August, the poleward shift of the North Pacific storm track enhances cyclone activity in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas.},

In this study, reflectivity profiles from the Global Precipitation Measurement Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (GPM-DPR) are used to evaluate precipitation and temperature characteristics of ARs over the western coast of North America and the eastern North Pacific Ocean. Evaluation of GPM-DPR bright-band height using a network of ground-based vertically pointing radars along the West Coast demonstrated exceptional agreement, and comparison with freezing level height from reanalyses over the eastern North Pacific Ocean also consistently agreed, indicating that GPM-DPR can be used to independently validate freezing level in models. However, precipitation comparison with gridded observations across the western United States indicated deficiencies in GPM-DPR’s ability to reproduce the spatial distribution of winter precipitation, likely related to sampling frequency. Over the geographically homogeneous oceanic portion of the domain, sampling frequency was not problematic, and significant differences in the frequency and intensity of precipitation between GPM-DPR and reanalyses highlighted biases in both satellite-observed and modeled AR precipitation. Reanalyses precipitation rates below the minimum sensitivity of GPM-DPR accounted for a 20\% increase in total precipitation, and 25\% of radar-derived precipitation rates were greater than the 99th percentile precipitation rate in reanalyses. Due to differences in the proportions of precipitation in convective, stratiform bright-band, and non-bright-band conditions, AR conditions contributed nearly 10\% more to total precipitation in GPM-DPR than reanalyses.},

	abstract = {The Indian monsoon system (IMS) is among the most complex and important climatic features on land. This study proposes a simple and robust method to investigate large-scale variations and changes in the IMS that accounts for fluctuations in amplitude, onset, and duration of the summer monsoon, including active and break phases, and the postmonsoon season. This study uses 35 years (1979-2013) of daily data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) at 1° resolution and indicates great potential for application to other reanalyses and climate model datasets. The method is based on combined EOF (CEOF) analysis of variables associated with the IMS's seasonal cycle (precipitation, circulation at 10 m, and temperature and specific humidity at 2 m). The first CEOF (CEOF-1) explains {\textasciitilde}40\% of the total variance and represents the continental-scale Asian monsoon. The second CEOF (CEOF-2) explains 11\% of the variance and characterizes the Indian monsoon variability, including increased precipitation over western, central, and northern parts of India and the monsoon onset and demise over those regions. Thus, CEOF-2 is referred to as the large-scale index for the Indian monsoon system (LIMS). It is shown that LIMS's amplitude is strongly correlated with the total June-September precipitation over India. LIMS is continuous in time and can be used to evaluate significant postmonsoon rainfall events that often affect the Indian subcontinent. Moreover, LIMS exhibits spectral variance on intraseasonal time scales that are associated with active and break phases of the monsoon during summer and enhanced rainfall in the postmonsoon period.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays a key role in the water cycle of High Asia and its downstream regions. The respective influence of the Indian and East Asian summer monsoon on TP precipitation and the regional water resources, together with the detection of moisture transport pathways and source regions are subject of recent research. In this study we present a twelve-year high-resolution climatology of the atmospheric water transport (AWT) on and towards the TP, using a new dataset, the High Asia Reanalysis (HAR), which better represents the complex topography of the TP and surrounding high mountain ranges than coarse resolution datasets. We focus on spatio-temporal patterns, vertical distribution and transport through the TP boundaries. The results show that the mid-latitude westerlies have a higher share in summertime AWT on the TP than assumed so far. Water vapour (WV) transport constitute the main part, whereby transports of water as cloud particles (CP) play also a role in winter in the Karakoram and western Himalayan regions. High mountain valleys in the Himalayas facilitate AWT from the south whereas the high mountain regions inhibit the AWT to a large extend and limit the influence of the Indian summer monsoon. No transport from the East Asian monsoon to the TP could be detected. Our results show that 40\% of the atmospheric moisture needed for precipitation comes from outside the TP, while the remaining 60\% are provided by local moisture recycling. How far precipitation variability can be explained by variable moisture supply has to be studied in future research by analysing the atmospheric dynamic and moisture recycling more in detail.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This paper compares a diverse set of ARDTs by applying them to a single location where a unique 12-year-long time-series from an atmospheric river observatory at Bodega Bay, California is available. The study quantifies the sensitivity of the diagnosed number, duration, and intensity of ARs at this location to the choice of ARDT, and to the choice of reanalysis data set. The ARDTs compared here represent a range of methods that vary in their use of different variables, fixed vs. percentile-based thresholds, geometric shape requirements, Eulerian vs. Lagrangian approaches, and reanalyses. The ARDTs were evaluated first using the datasets documented in their initial publication, which found an average annual count of 19 ± 7. Applying the ARDTs to the same reanalysis dataset yields an average annual count of 19 ± 4. Applying a single ARDT to three reanalyses of varying grid sizes (0.5°, 1.0°–2.5°) showed little sensitivity to the choice of reanalysis. While the annual average AR event count varied by about a factor of two (10–25 per year) depending on the ARDT, average AR duration and maximum intensity varied by less than ± 10\%, i.e., 24 ± 2 h duration; 458 ± 44 kg m − 1 s − 1 maximum IVT. ARDTs that use a much higher threshold for integrated vapor transport were compared separately, and yielded just 1–2 ARs annually on average. Generally, ARDTs that include either more stringent geometric criteria or higher thresholds identified the fewest AR events.},

The method, which is based on the maximum spatial correlation tracking technique (MASCOTTE), is a new alternative to the existent techniques available for studies that monitor the evolution of CS using satellite images. MASCOTTE provides as CS structural properties the following parameters: mean and variance of brightness temperature, horizontal area, perimeter, minimum brightness temperature, fractional convective area, center of gravity, and fragmentation. The fragmentation parameter has the potential to monitor the evolution of the CS. A new way of estimating the orientation and eccentricity of CS is proposed and is based on the empirical orthogonal function analysis of CS pixel coordinates. The method includes an accurate detection of splitting and merging of convective systems, which is a critical step in the automated satellite CS life cycle determination. Based on the magnitudes of the spatial correlation between consecutive satellite images and the changes in horizontal areas of CS, MASCOTTE provides a simple and skillful technique to track the evolution of CS life cycles. The MASCOTTE methodology is applied to infrared satellite images during seven consecutive days of the Wet-Season Atmospheric Mesoscale Campaign of the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment and ground validation experiment of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission in the Brazilian state of Rondoônia in the Amazon basin. The results indicate that MASCOTTE is a valuable approach to understanding the variability of CS.},

	abstract = {The Stratospheric-Tropospheric Experiment: Radiation, Aerosols and Ozone (STERAO)-Deep Convection Field Project with closely coordinated chemical, dynamical, electrical, and microphysical observations was conducted in northeastern Colorado during June and July of 1996 to investigate the production of NOX by lightning, the transport and redistribution of chemical species in the troposphere by thunderstorms, and the temporal evolution of intracloud and cloud-to-ground lightning for evolving storms on the Colorado high plains. Major observations were airborne chemical measurements in the boundary layer, middle and upper troposphere, and thunderstorm anvils; airborne and ground-based Doppler radar measurements; measurement of both intracloud (IC) and cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flash rates and locations; and multiparameter radar and in situ observations of microphysical structure. Cloud and mesoscale models are being used to synthesize and extend the observations. Herein we present an overview of the project and selected results for an isolated, severe storm that occurred on July 10. Time histories of reflectivity structure, IC and CG lightning flash rates, and chemical measurements in the boundary layer and in the anvil are presented showing large spatial and temporal variations. The observations for one period of time suggest that limited mixing of environmental air into the updraft core occurred during transport from cloud base to the anvil adjacent to the storm core. We deduce that the most likely contribution of lightning to the total NOX observed in the anvil is 60-90\% with a minimum of 45\%. For the July 10 storm the NOX produced by lightning was almost exclusively from IC flashes with a ratio of IC to total flashes {\textgreater}0.95 throughout most of the storm's lifetime. It is argued that in this storm and probably others, IC flashes can be major contributors to NOX production. Superposition of VHF lightning source locations on Doppler retrieved air motion fields for one 5 min time period shows that lightning activity occurred primarily in moderate updrafts and weak downdrafts with little excursion into the main downdraft. This may have important implications for the vertical redistribution of NOX resulting from lightning production, if found to be true at other times and in other storms.

Ten years' data of monthly lightning and hourly averaged monthly rainfall from 1998 to 2007 have been used for analysis, which shows quite different relationships between lightning and rainfall in monsoon and premonsoon seasons in this region. Very good positive correlation is observed between rainfall and lightning during the premonsoon period, however, in the monsoon period a correlation between them is not so good. The different relationship between lightning and rainfall in the monsoon and premonsoon has been attributed to the low updraft during the monsoon period due to low cloud base height and low aerosol concentration during this period. This analysis shows that deep electrified convective systems do form over the central Indian region during active monsoon periods; however the relationship between convective rainfall and lightning frequency during this period is not as consistent as during the premonsoon period. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Atmospheric river (AR) and non- AR events are analyzed to better understand the effect of this structure on precipitation patterns. Daily measurements of cool season precipitation at seven weather stations around the Tahoe basin from 1974 to 2012 and NCEP/CPC gridded daily precipitation analysis along the Sierra crest for the period 1948-2012 are examined. NCEP-NCAR reanalysis and soundings from Oakland are used to look at upper atmospheric conditions, including the presence of vapor transport by low- and midlevel jets on storm days as well as upstream static stability in relation to significant precipitation events. Key findings are as follows: 1) ARs play a disproportionately large role in generating Tahoe basin precipitation during the cool season; 2) strong midlevel vapor transport needs to occur in tandem with low-level transport to achieve the most extreme 2-day precipitation in the Tahoe basin; 3) when low- tomidlevel vapor transport is present on days with a defined AR, the local maximum in 2-day precipitation intensity decreases with distance from the Sierra crest, and on non-AR days, the relative increase in 2-day precipitation intensity due to low- and midlevel vapor transport does not vary based on distance from the Sierra crest; 4) AR and non-AR moisture fluxes are significantly modified by upstream static stability; and 5) understanding the impacts of ARs and their lower- and midlevel moisture flux structure are crucial components of the hydrometeorology in this region.},

The present study surveys the frequency with which ARs have played a critical role as a common cause of the end of droughts on the West Coast. This question was based on the observation that, in most cases, droughts end abruptly as a result of the arrival of an especially wet month or, more exactly, a few very large storms. This observation is documented using both Palmer Drought Severity Index and 6-month Standardized Precipitation Index measures of drought occurrence for climate divisions across the conterminous United States from 1895 to 2010. When the individual storm sequences that contributed most to the wet months that broke historical West Coast droughts from 1950 to 2010 were evaluated, 33\%-74\% of droughts were broken by the arrival of landfalling AR storms. In the Pacific Northwest, 60\%-74\%of all persistent drought endings have been brought about by the arrival of AR storms. In California, about 33\%-40\% of all persistent drought endings have been brought about by landfalling AR storms, with more localized low pressure systems responsible for many of the remaining drought breaks. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

	doi = {10.1130/S2006.2398(02)},
	abstract = {The extent to which orography may be a product of climate-erosion interactions is largely unknown. One grand challenge is to quantify the precipitation regimes of mountainous regions at the spatial and temporal scales relevant for investigating the interplay of erosion and tectonics in active orogens. In this paper, our objective is to synthesize recent research integrating numerical model simulations, satellite data, and surface observations in the Himalaya to elucidate the role of weather and climate in mountain evolution. We focus on the seasonal and interannual space-time variability of precipitation in the Great Himalayas by studying two preeminent storm regimes in detail-monsoon onsets and depressions in general, and wintertime Western Disturbances (cold season events). High-resolution simulations of heavy precipitation storms for two monsoon onset conditions (1999 and 2001) and one wintertime storm (2000) are used to illustrate the complex patterns of interaction between the mountains and the atmosphere, and to show how these affect the spatial distribution of precipitation. Along with observations from an existing ground-based network, these simulations provide unique insights into the space-time features of seasonal and interannual variability of precipitation. Our analysis indicates that the trajectory of monsoon storms during onset events exerts a strong control on the precipitation amounts and rainfall penetration into the rain shadow. Spatial variability of subsequent storm tracks in any given year helps explain the interannual variability of monsoon precipitation. Both observational data and our simulations define striking spatial variability in precipitation on upwind and downwind flanks of ridges that project into obliquely impinging storms. Specifically, as southeasterly monsoon winds encounter north-south oriented ridges, forced lifting of moist air enhances precipitation on the upwind flanks, whereas less precipitation occurs on downwind flanks. This variability is observed at spatial scales as short as ̃10 km-a distance equivalent to the spacing of major ridge crests. Because infrequent, singular storm events appear to control the mass input to glaciers, and may determine the frequency and spatial distribution of landslides, these findings provide physically based insight into decoupling highfrequency (seasonal to interannual time scales) from low-frequency (multidecadal to centennial and longer time scales) signals in the interpretation of climate and erosion records in the Himalayas. Furthermore, this research suggests that integrative studies aimed at unraveling the role of climate in landscape evolution must include consideration of storm frequency and intensity along with spatial variability at scales consistent with regional climate forcing.},

	abstract = {Winter westerly disturbances (WWD) are the primary climatic influence within High Mountain Asia during the boreal winter. Here we investigate variations and changes in WWD over the period 1979–2010 and relationships with heavy (85th percentile) precipitation in the Karakoram/western Himalaya (KH) and central Himalaya (CH) using multiple datasets. We show that heavy precipitation events occurring in the KH and CH are often spatiotemporally independent, suggesting differing behavior of WWD affecting each region. The wavelet power spectrum of 200 hPa geopotential height anomalies is used to characterize the frequency and magnitude of individual disturbances and to distinguish synoptic scale variability through time. Our analysis exhibits an enhancement in the strength and frequency of WWD in the KH and indicates an increase in local heavy precipitation events. In contrast, the CH is observed to experience weakening influence of these disturbances and consequently, a decrease in heavy precipitation. Furthermore, we investigate multi-annual variability of WWD and teleconnections with some known modes of climate variability affecting central Asia, including the Arctic Oscillation, Eurasian/Polar Pattern, the El Niño Southern Oscillation, and the Siberian High. Although there is clear evidence that these modes affect circulation and precipitation in High Mountain Asia, their competing influences on WWD are complex and non-linear. These results suggest that a thorough understanding of WWD and their spatiotemporal variations are crucial to improve our knowledge of the hydrologic cycle within High Mountain Asia as well as our ability to project the future status of Asia’s water resources.},

It is enabled by unique hourly observations collected over six years near California's Russian River and by recent advances in the science of atmospheric rivers (ARs). This study fills key gaps limiting the prediction of ARs and, especially, their impacts by quantifying the duration of AR conditions and the role of duration in modulating hydrometeorological impacts. Precursor soil moisture conditions and their relationship to streamflow are also shown. On the basis of 91 well-observed events during 2004-10, the study shows that the passage of ARs over a coastal site lasted 20 h on average and that 12\% of the AR events exceeded 30 h. Differences in storm-total water vapor transport directed up the mountain slope contribute 74\% of the variance in storm-total rainfall across the events and 61\%of the variance in storm-total runoff volume. ARs with double the composite mean duration produced nearly 6 times greater peak streamflow and more than 7 times the storm-total runoff volume. When precursor soil moisture was less than 20\%, even heavy rainfall did not lead to significant streamflow. Predicting which AR events are likely to produce extreme impacts on precipitation and runoff requires accurate prediction ofARduration at landfall and observations of precursor soil moisture conditions. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.© 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Understanding the role of climate variability in modulating the behavior of land-falling atmospheric rivers (ARs) is important for seasonal and subseasonal predictability for water resource management and flood control. We examine daily activity of ARs targeting the Northern California coast over six decades using observations of synoptic-scale circulation, high-resolution precipitation, and a long-term AR detection catalog to quantify distinct types of land-falling ARs categorized by their circulation features. We demonstrate how dramatically different atmospheric states evolve into landfalling ARs along distinct pathways that are modulated by interannual (El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and subseasonal (Arctic Oscillation, Pacific North American Pattern, Western Pacific Oscillation, and the Eastern Pacific Oscillation) modes of large-scale climate variability. Different configurations of climate variability modes are shown to favor ARs having different characteristics in terms of synoptic evolution, integrated vapor transport and landfall orientation resulting in different patterns of precipitation over the landscape. In particular, our results show that while ENSO plays an important role in modulating the synoptic evolution of ARs and their orientation at landfall, subseasonal regional climate modes, which also influence landfall orientation as well as the position of the storm track, appear to be more influential than ENSO in modulating precipitation variability in California. This could have implications for seasonal to subseasonal (S2S) forecasting. Finally, we examine AR activity over the most recent and highly anomalous winter 2016–2017 and show how the unprecedented wet conditions in Northern California were at least partly due to the persistence of ARs characterized by a southward storm track and southerly orientation, which represent the type of ARs associated with heavy rainfall in California, and which are associated with the negative phase of subseasonal regional teleconnection patterns.},

The MERRA project focuses on historical climate analyses for a broad range of weather and climate time scales and places the NASA EOS suite of observations in a climate context. MERRA-2 was initiated as an intermediate project between the aging MERRA data and the next generation of Earth system analysis envisioned for the future coupled reanalysis. Without a substantial investment to update MERRA's data assimilation routines, the system lacked the capability to analyze the latest observations. In addition, numerous advances to the GEOS5 system had been implemented since freezing the MERRA system in 2008. Therefore, a new full reanalysis integration was undertaken. MERRA-2 covers the period 1980-present, continuing as an ongoing climate analysis as resources allow.},

The western United States is known for its water shortages due to large seasonal and inter-annual variability of precipitation as well as increasing demand. Climate change will impact the availability of water in the western United States through the modification of precipitation characteristics. Satellite data presents the opportunity to study these changes at a fine, continuous spatial resolution-particularly in places where no traditional ground observations exist. Utilizing the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 version 7 precipitation data, this study examines the spatio-temporal changes in precipitation characteristics over the western United States between 1998 and 2015, and their connections with the atmospheric total column water vapor and the El Niño Southern Oscillation during the winter season. The results show that precipitation frequency in the western United States has been decreasing in general, precipitation totals and mean daily intensity are increasing in northwestern United States, but decreasing in the southwest United States during the 18 years of the study time period. Additionally, results show a strong relationship between total column water vapor and the precipitation characteristics, specifically in the southwestern United States.},

We use a suite of models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5, historical and RCP8.5 scenarios) and other observations to estimate AR frequency and mean daily precipitation. Despite its arid-to-semi-arid climate, parts of the MENA region experience strong ARs, which contribute a large fraction of the annual precipitation, such as in the mountainous areas of Turkey and Iran. This study shows that by the end of this century, AR frequency is projected to increase ({\textasciitilde}20\&ndash;40\%) for the North Africa and Mediterranean areas (including any region with higher latitudes than 35 N). However, for these regions, mean daily precipitation (i.e., regardless of the presence of ARs) is projected to decrease ({\textasciitilde}15\&ndash;30\%). For the rest of the MENA region, including the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa, minor changes in AR frequency (\&plusmn;10\%) are expected, yet mean precipitation is projected to increase ({\textasciitilde}50\%) for these regions. Overall, the projected sign of change in AR frequency is opposite to the projected sign of change in mean daily precipitation for most areas within the MENA region.},

The two products show relatively good agreement, with 10-15 persistent ARs (lasting 18 h or longer) occurring on average per winter and nearly two-thirds of these systems occurring poleward of 358S. The relationship between persistentARactivity and winter rainfall is demonstrated using South African Weather Service rainfall data. Most stations positioned in areas of high topography contained the highest percentage of rainfall contributed by persistent ARs, whereas stations downwind, to the east of the major topographic barriers, had the lowest contributions. Extreme rainfall days in the region are also ranked by their magnitude and spatial extent. The results suggest that although persistent ARs are important contributors to heavy rainfall events, they are not necessarily a prerequisite. It is found that around 70\% of the top 50 daily winter rainfall extremes in South Africa were in some way linked to ARs (both persistent and nonpersistent). Overall, the findings of this study support similar investigations on ARs in the North Atlantic and North Pacific.},

	abstract = {The term "atmospheric river" is used to describe corridors of strong water vapor transport in the troposphere. Filaments of enhanced water vapor, commonly observed in satellite imagery extending from the subtropics to the extratropics, are routinely used as a proxy for identifying these regions of strong water vapor transport. The precipitation associated with these filaments of enhanced water vapor can lead to high-impact flooding events. However, there remains some debate as to how these filaments form. In this paper, the authors analyze the transport of water vapor within a climatology of wintertime North Atlantic extratropical cyclones. Results show that atmospheric rivers are formed by the cold front that sweeps up water vapor in the warm sector as it catches up with the warm front. This causes a narrow band of high water vapor content to form ahead of the cold front at the base of the warm conveyor belt airflow. Thus, water vapor in the cyclone's warm sector, not long-distance transport of water vapor from the subtropics, is responsible for the generation of filaments of high water vapor content. A continuous cycle of evaporation and moisture convergence within the cyclone replenishes water vapor lost via precipitation. Thus, rather than representing a direct and continuous feed of moist air from the subtropics into the center of a cyclone (as suggested by the term "atmospheric river"), these filaments are, in fact, the result of water vapor exported from the cyclone, and thus they represent the footprints left behind as cyclones travel poleward from the subtropics.},

	abstract = {A record-setting temperature of 17.5°C occurred on 24 March 2015 at the Esperanza station located near the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP). We studied the event using surface station data, satellite imagery, reanalysis data, and numerical simulations. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Antarctic Ice Shelf Image Archive provides clear evidence for disintegration and advection of sea ice, as well as the formation of melt ponds on the ice sheet surface at the base of the AP mountain range. A deep low-pressure center over the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea and a blocking ridge over the southeast Pacific provided favorable conditions for the development of an atmospheric river with a northwest-southeast orientation, directing warm and moist air toward the AP, and triggering a widespread foehn episode. A control simulation using a regional climate model shows the existence of local topographically induced warming along the northern tip of the AP (∼60\% of the full temperature signal) and the central part of the eastern AP (90\% of the full temperature signal) with respect to a simulation without topography. These modeling results suggest that more than half of the warming experienced at Esperanza can be attributed to the foehn effect (a local process), rather than to the large-scale advection of warm air from the midlatitudes. Nevertheless, the local foehn effect also has a large-scale advection component, since the atmospheric river provides water vapor for orographic precipitation enhancement and latent heat release, which makes it difficult to completely disentangle the role of local versus large-scale processes in explaining the extreme event.},

OTD collected data from May 1995 to March 2000. LIS data (equatorward of about 38°) adds the years 1998-2010. Flash counts from each instrument are scaled by the best available estimates of detection efficiency. The long LIS record makes the merged climatology most robust in the tropics and subtropics, while the high latitude data is entirely from OTD. The gridded climatologies include annual mean flash rate on a 0.5° grid, mean diurnal cycle of flash rate on a 2.5° grid with 24. hour resolution, mean annual cycle of flash rate on a 0.5° or 2.5° grid with daily, monthly, or seasonal resolution, mean annual cycle of the diurnal cycle on a 2.5° grid with two hour resolution for each day, and time series of flash rate over the sixteen year record with roughly three-month smoothing. For some of these (e.g., annual cycle of the diurnal cycle), more smoothing is necessary for results to be robust.The mean global flash rate from the merged climatology is 46flashess-1. This varies from around 35flashess-1 in February (austral summer) to 60flashess-1 in August (boreal summer). The peak annual flash rate at 0.5° scale is 160flkm-2yr-1 in eastern Congo. The peak monthly average flash rate at 2.5° scale is 18flkm-2mo-1 from early April to early May in the Brahmaputra Valley of far eastern India. Lightning decreases in this region during the monsoon season, but increases further north and west. An August peak in northern Pakistan also exceeds any monthly averages from Africa, despite central Africa having the greatest yearly average. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

This study uses satellite-based radar reflectivity profiles from the Global Precipitation Measurement Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (GPM-DPR), combined with kinematic and thermodynamic conditions in the vicinity of the precipitation diagnosed from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, to evaluate the characteristics and dynamical origins of precipitation in ARs over the northeast Pacific Ocean. Transects of 192 ARs between 2014 and 2018 are examined. Both stratiform and convective precipitation were abundant in these GPM transects and the precipitation was most often generated by forced ascent in the vicinity of a cold front in frontogenetic environments. Conditioning composite vertical profiles of reflectivity and latent heating from GPM-DPR on frontogenesis near the moist-neutral low-level jet demonstrated the importance of frontally forced precipitation on atmospheric heating tendencies. A case study of a high-impact landfalling AR is analyzed using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model, which showed how the precipitation processes and subsequent latent heat release offshore strongly influenced AR evolution. Although these precipitation mechanisms are present in global-scale models, the difficulty that coarse-resolution models have in accurately representing resultant precipitation likely translates to uncertainty in forecasting heating tendencies, their feedbacks on AR evolution, and ultimately the impacts of ARs upon landfall in the western United States.},

Our analysis shows the potential of ARs in predicting extreme precipitation events at a daily scale, with Gilbert Skill Scores of {\textasciitilde}0.2. Monthly extreme precipitation amount in west coast watersheds is closely related to AR intensity, with correlation coefficients of up to 0.6. The relationship between ARs and precipitation is most significant in the Pacific Northwest and California. Using a K-means clustering algorithm, ARs can be classified into three categories: weak ARs, flash ARs, and prolonged ARs. Flash ARs and prolonged ARs, though accounting for less than 50\% of total AR events, are more important in controlling extreme precipitation patterns and should be prioritized for future studies of hydrological extreme events.},

In this study, an investigation is made into the previously unexplored contribution of the synoptic-scale waves and their attendant atmospheric rivers to the TEAM mechanism. Reanalysis data are used to conduct a suite of observational analyses, trajectory calculations, and idealized model simulations. It is shown that localized tropical convection over the Maritime Continent precedes the peak of the planetary-scale wave life cycle by {\textasciitilde}10-14 days. The Rossby wave source induced by the tropical convection excites a Rossby wave train over the North Pacific that amplifies the climatological December-March stationary waves. These amplified planetary-scale waves are baroclinic and transport sensible and latent heat poleward. During the planetary-scale wave life cycle, synoptic-scale waves are diverted northward over the central North Pacific. The warm conveyor belts associated with the synoptic-scale waves channel moisture from the subtropics into atmospheric rivers that ascend as they move poleward and penetrate into the Arctic near the Bering Strait. At this time, the synoptic-scale waves undergo cyclonic Rossby wave breaking, which further amplifies the planetary-scale waves. The planetary-scale wave life cycle ceases as ridging over Alaska retrogrades westward. The ridging blocks additional moisture transport into the Arctic. However, sensible and latent heat amounts remain elevated over the Arctic, which enhances downward infrared radiation and maintains warm surface temperatures.},

	abstract = {The main focus of the present study is to examine the presence of Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) in the occurrence of Chennai (13.5° N, 80.5° E) flood event over Tamil Nadu which is south-eastern part of Indian peninsular region of India during November to December 2015. The vertically integrated horizontal water vapor transport (IVT) algorithm was used for the detection of ARs using three different reanalysis products, namely, the NCEP-NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research), NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim). It is noticed that the occurrence of heavy precipitation events (HPEs) prior to the flood in the Chennai city, has been in good agreement with the presence of ARs during that time. The distribution from TRMM-3B42RT, TRMM-3B42 are validated with the with in situ rain gauge observations over the Chennai city. We have conducted quantitative analysis of IVT and their impact on heavy precipitation events and flood occurred over Chennai city. It is seen that MERRA reanalysis could be able to provide better presence of ARs. The study mainly reveals that persistent ARs of {\textgreater}18 h resulted in extremely heavy precipitation and lead to associated flood over Chennai. Also, the atmospheric conditions, ARs and rainfall simulated from Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model (ARW) show good agreement with reanalysis and observations. Over the given reference period 1979–2015, correlation between IVT and HPEs is statistically significant at 99.5\% confidence level. But the correlation between IVT during persistent ARs and corresponding HPEs is statistically significant at 90\% confidence level. A large fraction of HPEs occur after ARs, with a small portion of ARs would lead to HPEs. The Chennai gird historical rainfall data is suitably fitted by Extreme Value Distribution (EVD) models. Inference model using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) was applied on EVD considering their impact on the shape parameter and the confidence interval width. A Non-stationary generalized extreme value (GEV) analysis, was used to determine the strength of association between the precipitation extremes and IVT. The influence of the location and the scale parameter in the GEV model on different return levels (2-year, 20-year, and 100-year) are explicitly described. The return-level threshold values are found to change with IVT considerably. This study advocates that the detection of ARs can be used as important proxy in identifying the likelihood of occurrence of heavy precipitation/flash flood events for a given location using reanalysis data sets.},

Climatic variability and change of both precipitation and energy inputs will, therefore, affect rural livelihoods at both a local and a regional scale through effects on summer runoff in the River Indus. Spatial variation in precipitation has been investigated by correlation and regression analysis of long-period records. There is a strong positive correlation between winter precipitation at stations over the entire region, so that, for practical forecasting of summer runoff in some basins, a single valley-floor precipitation station can be used. In contrast, spatial relationships in seasonal precipitation are weaker in summer and sometimes significantly negative between stations north and south of the Himalayan divide. Although analysis of long datasets of precipitation from 1895 shows no significant trend, from 1961-1999 there are statistically significant increases in winter, in summer and in the annual precipitation in several stations. Preliminary analysis has identified a significant positive correlation between the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO) and winter precipitation in the Karakoram and a negative correlation between a monthly NAO index and summer rainfall at some stations. © EGU.},

In this article, their temporal and spatial changes in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region have been investigated during a period of 30 years (1984–2013). After extracting the days with ARs, their frequency and sources were identified. In order to study the formation and moisture feeding mechanism of the ARs, the jet stream and atmospheric stream maps were produced, and their sources and movement paths were identified. The results showed that each year, about 13 ARs were observed and most of them occurred in the fall and winter seasons. The major reason for the formation of ARs is jet streams which, in all selected cases, were located about 100–150 hPa above the ARs. Most ARs originated over the North Atlantic Ocean and entered Africa from Mauritania and Senegal and after passing Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iran entered Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Red Sea is a major moisture source which feeds ARs on their path. The results showed that the ARs in the MENA region experience convergence over this region which causes these events to narrow. A large number of the countries that studied is desert, the findings can be utilized in understanding the ways ARs can be useful and shortage of water resources in the region can be compensated.},

These interact in multiple ways and can have tremendous impacts on populations proximate to or downstream of these initial triggers. High Mountain Asia (HMA) is extremely vulnerable to cascading hazard processes given the tectonic, geomorphologic, and climatic setting of the region, particularly as it relates to glacial lakes. Given the limitations of in situ surveys in steep and often inaccessible terrain, remote sensing data are a valuable resource for better understanding and quantifying these processes. The present work provides a survey of cascading hazard processes impacting HMA and how these can be characterized using remote sensing sources. We discuss how remote sensing products can be used to address these process chains, citing several examples of cascading hazard scenarios across HMA. This work also provides a perspective on the current gaps and challenges, community needs, and view forward towards improved characterization of evolving hazards and risk across HMA.},

	abstract = {The hydrological budget of Himalayan rivers is dominated by monsoonal rainfall and snowmelt, but their relative impact is not well established because this remote region lacks a dense gauge network. Here, we use a combination of validated remotely-sensed climate parameters to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall, snowfall, and evapotranspiration in order to quantify their relative contribution to mean river discharge. Rainfall amounts are calculated from calibrated, orbital, high-resolution Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission data, and snow-water equivalents are computed from a snowmelt model based on satellite-derived snow cover, surface temperature, and solar radiation. Our data allow us to identify three key aspects of the spatiotemporal precipitation pattern. First, we observe a strong decoupling between the rainfall on the Himalayan foreland versus that in the mountains: a pronounced sixfold, east-west rainfall gradient in the Ganges plains exists only at elevations {\textless}500 m asl. Mountainous regions (500 to 5000 m asl) receive nearly equal rainfall amounts along strike. Second, whereas the Indian summer monsoon is responsible for more than 80\% of annual rainfall in the central Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, the eastern and western syntaxes receive only ∼50\% of their annual rainfall during the summer season. Third, snowmelt contributions to discharge differ widely along the range. As a fraction of the total annual discharge, snowmelt constitutes up to 50\% in the far western (Indus area) catchments, ∼25\% in far eastern (Tsangpo) catchments, and {\textless}20\% elsewhere. Despite these along-strike variations, snowmelt in the pre- and early-monsoon season (April to June) is significant and important in all catchments, although most pronounced in the western catchments. Thus, changes in the timing or amount of snowmelt due to increasing temperatures or decreasing winter precipitation may have far-reaching societal consequences. These new data on precipitation and runoff set the stage for far more detailed investigations than have previously been possible of climate-erosion interactions in the Himalaya.

	abstract = {The continuous satisfactory functioning of satellite-borne devices for the detection of global lightning offers the opportunity to explore relationships between lightning frequency f and other thundercloud parameters, notably, in this paper, the precipitating and non-precipitating contents and fluxes of ice. Simple calculations predict that the lightning frequency f is proportional to the product of the downward flux of solid precipitation through the body of the thundercloud and the upward flux of ice crystals into its anvil. This prediction is reinforced by computations performed using the multiple lightning model of Baker et al. [Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc. 121 (1995) 1525; Atmos. Res. 51 (1999) 221]. Calculations indicate that the separation of charge and associated field development in thunderclouds are not significantly limited by charge saturation of the interacting hydrometeors: and that the mutual interactions of graupel pellets in the charging zones of thunderstorms can significantly enhance electric field development, culminating in lightning. An examination of data from the satellite-borne Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) and TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) suggests that thunderstorms with the highest frequency of total lightning also possess the most pronounced microwave scattering signatures at 37 and 85 GHz. A total of 292 individual thunderstorms were examined, and a log-linear relationship was shown to exist (one for each frequency) between the number of optical lightning pulses produced by each storm and the corresponding microwave brightness temperatures. These relationships are consistent throughout the seasons in a variety of regimes (12 sites encompassing five continents, as well as oceanic measurements), suggesting that global relationships may be found to exist between lightning activity and cloud ice content. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The model is configured for the Mississippi River Basin and driven by the North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 atmospheric forcing at 1/8° resolution. The simulations are compared with various observational data sets, including the U.S. Geological Survey streamflow and groundwater data, the AmeriFlux tower micrometeorological evapotranspiration (ET) measurements, the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN)-observed soil moisture data, and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite-derived terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomaly data. Compared with these observations and to the baseline Noah LSM simulations, Noah-MP shows significant improvement in hydrological modeling for major hydrological variables (runoff, groundwater, ET, soil moisture, and TWS), which is very likely due to the incorporation of some major improvements into Noah-MP, particularly an unconfined aquifer storage layer for groundwater dynamics and an interactive vegetation canopy for dynamic leaf phenology. Noah-MP produces soil moisture values consistent with the SCAN observations for the top two soil layers (0–10 cm and 10–40 cm), indicating its great potential to be used in studying land-atmosphere coupling. In addition, the simulated groundwater spatial patterns are comparable to observations; however, the inclusion of groundwater in Noah-MP requires a longer spin-up time (34 years for the entire study domain). Runoff simulation is highly sensitive to three parameters: the surface dryness factor (α), the saturated hydraulic conductivity (k), and the saturated soil moisture (θmax).},

In this study, the Noah and Noah-MP land surface models with multiple groundwater sub-models are used to assess how the treatment of canopy processes and interactions with deep groundwater affect 6 month regional climate simulations in two contrasting years, 2002 and 2010. Unlike the free drainage models, the models with groundwater capability have upward flux from the aquifer at different periods in the simulation. The inter-model Noah-MP soil moisture and latent heat flux results are consistent with recharge differences: the stronger upward flux capability with interactive groundwater results in the highest soil moisture and latent heat flux of the Noah-MP models. The increased latent heat effect on increased precipitation is small, which may result from negligible differences in convective precipitation. The Noah-MP model, independent of groundwater option, improves upon a cold and dry bias in the spring Noah simulations both during the day and night. The results for summer are region dependent and also differ between year and time of day. For a majority of the simulation period, there is little groundwater effect on the Noah-MP near-surface diagnostic fields. However, when the Noah-MP model produces large warm/dry biases in the 2010 summer, the aquifer interactions in Noah-MP improve the air temperature bias by 1–2 °C and dew point temperature bias by 1 °C.},

	abstract = {Both the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) are regularly employed in model evaluation studies. Willmott and Matsuura (2005) have suggested that the RMSE is not a good indicator of average model performance and might be a misleading indicator of average error, and thus the MAE would be a better metric for that purpose. While some concerns over using RMSE raised by Willmott and Matsuura (2005) and Willmott et al. (2009) are valid, the proposed avoidance of RMSE in favor of MAE is not the solution. Citing the aforementioned papers, many researchers chose MAE over RMSE to present their model evaluation statistics when presenting or adding the RMSE measures could be more beneficial. In this technical note, we demonstrate that the RMSE is not ambiguous in its meaning, contrary to what was claimed by Willmott et al. (2009). The RMSE is more appropriate to represent model performance than the MAE when the error distribution is expected to be Gaussian. In addition, we show that the RMSE satisfies the triangle inequality requirement for a distance metric, whereas Willmott et al. (2009) indicated that the sums-of-squares-based statistics do not satisfy this rule. In the end, we discussed some circumstances where using the RMSE will be more beneficial. However, we do not contend that the RMSE is superior over the MAE. Instead, a combination of metrics, including but certainly not limited to RMSEs and MAEs, are often required to assess model performance. © Author(s) 2014. CC Attribution 3.0 License.},

	abstract = {This study investigates variability in the intensity of the wintertime Siberian high (SH) by defining a robust SH index (SHI) and correlating it with selected meteorological fields and teleconnection indices. A dramatic trend of -2.5 hPa decade-1 has been found in the SHI between 1978 and 2001 with unprecedented (since 1871) low values of the SHI. The weakening of the SH has been confirmed by analyzing different historical gridded analyses and individual station observations of sea level pressure (SLP) and excluding possible effects from the conversion of surface pressure to SLP. SHI correlation maps with various meteorologic al fields show that SH impacts on circulation and temperature patterns extend far outside the SH source area extending from the Arctic to the tropical Pacific. Advection of warm air from eastern Europe has been identified as the main mechanism causing milder than normal conditions over the Kara and Laptev Seas in association with a strong SH. Despite the strong impacts of the variability in the SH on climatic variability across the Northern Hemisphere, correlations between the SHI and the main teleconnection indices of the Northern Hemisphere are weak. Regression analysis has shown that teleconnection indices are not able to reproduce the interannual variability and trends in the SH. The inclusion of regional surface temperature in the regression model provides closer agreement between the original and reconstructed SHI. © 2005 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Thunderstorms, and lightning in particular, are a major natural hazard to the public, aviation, power companies, and wildfire managers. Lightning causes great damage and death every year but also tells us about the inner working of storms. Since lightning can be monitored from great distances from the storms themselves, lightning may allow us to provide early warnings for severe weather phenomena such as hail storms, flash floods, tornadoes, and even hurricanes. Lightning itself may impact the climate of the Earth by producing nitrogen oxides (NOx), a precursor of tropospheric ozone, which is a powerful greenhouse gas. Thunderstorms themselves influence the climate system by the redistribution of heat, moisture, and momentum in the atmosphere. What about future changes in lightning and thunderstorm activity? Many studies show that higher surface temperatures produce more lightning, but future changes will depend on what happens to the vertical temperature profile in the troposphere, as well as changes in water balance, and even aerosol loading of the atmosphere. Finally, lightning itself may provide a useful tool for tracking climate change in the future, due to the nonlinear link between lightning, temperature, upper tropospheric water vapor, and cloud cover. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The reason frequently given for this behaviour is that the height of the freezing level, and hence the negative charge center in thunderstorms, varies with latitude, resulting in higher ratios in the tropics compared with those in midlatitudes. This study shows that this hypothesis could well be incorrect. Analysis of cloud and lightning data indicates that the IC/CG ratio is linked to the thickness of the cold cloud region in thunderstorms (0°C to cloud top), rather than to the freezing level height.

	abstract = {The spatiotemporal variability of lightning activity in the region of the Himalayan foothills and perpendicular to it has been examined from about 16-year data from the TRMM satellite. The monthly mean flash rate for the period from 1995 to 2010 is maximum in an arc-shaped area along the Himalayan foothills and decreases on both the north and south sides of it. Seasonal variation of mean flash rate changes from annual to semiannual as the area shifts from north to south of the Himalayas and the average elevation of area decreases from 5043m to 219m. Further, the mean flash rate is higher in the afternoon and lower from midnight to midday. In the Himalayan foothills, the mean flash rate is highly correlated with surface temperature but poorly correlated with the convective available potential energy (CAPE). Lightning flashes occurring in the high-altitude regions, as compared to the low-altitude regions, are less energetic but more frequent. The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis has been applied to three different data sets of flash rates, surface temperature, and CAPE in the 18.75N-36N and 68.75E-93.75E area for the period of 1995-2010 to examine the relationship between these parameters in terms of seasonal variations in this region. Spatial distributions of the first mode of flash rate and CAPE and of the first and second modes of surface temperature indicate that the Himalayan range exerts a strong effect on the flash rate distributions in this region. However, while the first mode of spatial distribution of flash rate is in phase with the surface temperature, the time series of CAPE and flash rate are out of phase for the first mode but in phase for their second modes. This result amounts to that 65\% of variability in CAPE cannot be associated with the changes in flash rate but 22\% of CAPE variability can be associated with changes in flash rate. Higher values of flash rate in the Himalayan foothills are suggested to be associated with the diurnal cycle of a mountain breeze front. Relative roles of convective activities due to solar heating of land, orography of the region, and the synoptic convective systems embedded in monsoon current are discussed to explain the results. © 2012.

	abstract = {Precipitation is one of the main factors which controls surface processes and landscape morphology. Large orogenic belts such as the Himalayas control precipitation distribution as a result of orographic effects due to their prominent relief. However, precipitation is difficult to monitor because mountain regions are largely inaccessible and therefore not sufficiently covered by ground-based gauge stations. The complexity of orographic effects resulting from the interaction between elevation and climatic processes and the lack of precise meteorological data thus limit our understanding of climatic influence on landscape formation. Therefore, high-quality precipitation observations with good spatiotemporal coverage are needed. Here we evaluate five gridded precipitation data sets derived from remote sensing and interpolation of rain gauge data with ground-based precipitation measurements. First, we evaluate the bulk error of each data set, then we evaluate the temporal quality of data within five watersheds, and last we compare the spatial performance along seven swath profiles across strike to the Himalayan range in Nepal. Our evaluation shows that the data sets vary significantly along the orographic front and get more consistent toward the adjacent low-relief domains, while bulk errors are largest during monsoon season. In particular, where topographic gradients are important, the resolution of gridded data sets cannot incorporate small-scale spatial changes of precipitation. We show that the data set derived from interpolation of gauge data performs best in the Himalayas. This study gives an overview on the applicability of precipitation data sets within the Himalayan orographic domains where relief has a pronounced impact on precipitation.

	abstract = {Using available instrumental records, this paper examines the variation of precipitation from 1866 to 2006 in the northwestern Himalaya (NWH). The study indicates no trend in the winter precipitation but significant decreasing trend in the monsoon precipitation during the study period. Periodicities on a multi-decadal scale (29-34 years and 58-64 years) obtained in power spectrum analyses point towards epochal behaviour in the precipitation series. Analyses of the temperature data show significant increasing trends in annual temperature in all three stations in the NWH during the data period. Warming effect is particularly noteworthy during the winter season. Negative relationships between mean winter air temperature and snowfall amounts recorded at different meteorological stations in this period reveal strong effect of rising temperatures on the decreasing snowfall component in total winter precipitation, reducing effective duration of winter on the windward side of the Pir Panjal Himalayan Range. The study also shows influence of global teleconnections [North-Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) during winter months and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) during the monsoon months] on precipitation fluctuations in the NWH. The teleconnections that appear to exist between the precipitation and the temperature until the late 1960s seem to have weakened considerably in the last three decades. This may be ascribed to the diminishing effect of the natural factors such as quasi-biennial oscillations (QBO), El Niño Southern Oscillations (ENSO), double sunspot cycles (Hale), etc., in this period. Role of increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere cannot be ruled out. © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Changes and trends in ten extreme daily rainfall indices in the La Plata Basin (LPB) during the 1981–2018 period were analyzed. These indices were evaluated for three regions in the LPB, namely the northern, central, and southern LPB (N-LPB, C-LPB, and S-LPB, respectively). A decrease in the maximum rainfall over five consecutive days (RX5day) and an increase in the consecutive dry days (CDD) were observed in N-LPB, mainly during the austral winter. An increase in the total wet-day precipitation was found in S-LPB, particularly during September–November (SON), and during December–February (DJF). The number of heavy precipitation days (R10mm) and CDD indices in S-LPB during SON showed a breaking point in 1999 and were followed by an increase in R10mm after 1999. Therefore, we discussed the large-scale climatic features that could be related to the breaking point in the extreme precipitation indices found in the S-LPB during SON, through correlation analysis. Our results indicate that R10mm shows significant positive correlations with the sea surface temperature (SST) in the Southwestern Subtropical Atlantic Region, mainly between 32°S–22°S and 50 W–34°W. The SST anomaly index in this oceanic region for SON during 1981–2018 displayed a significant upward change in 1999. Furthermore, the correlation map between this index and the vertically integrated moisture flux (VIMF) and its divergence, shows negative correlations in the S-LPB, which means a decrease of the moisture divergence in this region. This implies an increase (decrease) of R10mm, and a decrease (increase) of CDD in the S-LPB after (before) 1999. This relationship results from an anticyclone in the Southwestern Atlantic extending into the LPB up to 60°W, which causes an increase in the northwesterly moisture flux over central and southern parts of the basin, enhancing the moisture convergence over S-LPB. These insights have not been discussed previously, and might be relevant for future modeling studies and monitoring tasks.},

	doi = {10.1175/JCLI3816.1},
	abstract = {In situ observations of surface air and dewpoint temperatures and air pressure from over 15 000 weather stations and from ships are used to calculate surface specific (q) and relative ( RH) humidity over the globe (60 degrees S - 75 degrees N) from December 1975 to spring 2005. Seasonal and interannual variations and linear trends are analyzed in relation to observed surface temperature ( T) changes and simulated changes by a coupled climate model [ namely the Parallel Climate Model (PCM)] with realistic forcing. It is found that spatial patterns of long-term mean q are largely controlled by climatological surface temperature, with the largest q of 17 - 19 g kg(-1) in the Tropics and large seasonal variations over northern mid- and high-latitude land. Surface RH has relatively small spatial and interannual variations, with a mean value of 75\% - 80\% over most oceans in all seasons and 70\% - 80\% over most land areas except for deserts and high terrain, where RH is 30\% - 60\%. Nighttime mean RH is 2\% - 15\% higher than daytime RH over most land areas because of large diurnal temperature variations. The leading EOFs in both q and RH depict long-term trends, while the second EOF of q is related to the El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During 1976 - 2004, global changes in surface RH are small ( within 0.6\% for absolute values), although decreasing trends of - 0.11\% similar to- 0.22\% decade(-1) for global oceans are statistically significant. Large RH increases (0.5\% - 2.0\% decade(-1)) occurred over the central and eastern United States, India, and western China, resulting from large q increases coupled with moderate warming and increases in low clouds over these regions during 1976 - 2004. Statistically very significant increasing trends are found in global and Northern Hemispheric q and T. From 1976 to 2004, annual q ( T) increased by 0.06 g kg(-1) (0.16 degrees C) decade(-1) globally and 0.08 g kg(-1) (0.20 degrees C) decade(-1) in the Northern Hemisphere, while the Southern Hemispheric q trend is positive but statistically insignificant. Over land, the q and T trends are larger at night than during the day. The largest percentage increases in surface q ( similar to 1.5\% to 6.0\% decade(-1)) occurred over Eurasia where large warming ( similar to 0.2 degrees to 0.7 degrees C decade(-1)) was observed. The q and T trends are found in all seasons over much of Eurasia ( largest in boreal winter) and the Atlantic Ocean. Significant correlation between annual q and T is found over most oceans ( r = 0.6 - 0.9) and most of Eurasia ( r = 0.4 - 0.8), whereas it is insignificant over subtropical land areas. RH - T correlation is weak over most of the globe but is negative over many arid areas. The q - T anomaly relationship is approximately linear so that surface q over the globe, global land, and ocean increases by similar to 4.9\%, 4.3\%, and 5.7\% per 1 degrees C warming, respectively, values that are close to those suggested by the Clausius - Clapeyron equation with a constant RH. The recent q and T trends and the q - T relationship are broadly captured by the PCM; however, the model overestimates volcanic cooling and the trends in the Southern Hemisphere.},

One of the key features of amplified Arctic warming concerns Arctic winter warming (AWW), which exceeds summer warming by at least a factor of 4. Here we use observation-driven reanalyses and state-of-the-art climate models in a variety of standardised climate change simulations to show that AWW is strongly linked to winter sea ice retreat through the associated release of surplus ocean heat gained in summer through the ice-albedo feedback ({\textasciitilde}25\%), and to infrared radiation feedbacks ({\textasciitilde}75\%). Arctic summer warming is surprisingly modest, even after summer sea ice has completely disappeared. Quantifying the seasonally varying changes in Arctic temperature and sea ice and the associated feedbacks helps to more accurately quantify the likelihood of Arctic's climate changes, and to assess their impact on local ecosystems and socio-economic activities.},
