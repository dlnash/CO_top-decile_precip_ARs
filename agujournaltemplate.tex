\begin{abstract}
Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play an important role in weather and hydroclimate throughout the western U.S., and extensive knowledge of AR frequency, intensity, impacts, and key meteorological processes has been developed primarily focused on the U.S. West Coast landfalling ARs. Relatively little work has examined AR characteristics further inland, particularly for Colorado, where high and complex topography, as well as distance from the coast, frustrate attempts to track ARs, AR-derived moisture, and AR-related impacts. Previous research efforts attributing precipitation to ARs based on their spatial footprint have yielded less than 30\% of cool-season precipitation in Colorado as related to ARs. However, a large volume of anecdotal evidence suggests that ARs play a larger role in Colorado precipitation, but this requires quantitative investigation. This work uses trajectory-based methods to explore the role of landfalling ARs, their moisture pathways, and their contribution to top-decile precipitation in subbasins throughout Colorado. We show that moisture sourced from landfalling ARs affects this area more frequently, penetrating inland along relatively low-elevation corridors through the Interior West, and exhibit substantial geographic and interannual variability. The backward trajectory approach for attributing precipitation to landfalling ARs yields higher AR contributions to top-decile precipitation (10–70\%), primarily affecting western Colorado. The main pathway for landfalling AR moisture to contribute to top-decile precipitation is from landfalling ARs near Southern California and the Baja Peninsula in both the cool and warm seasons. These results indicate a larger role for ARs in Colorado weather and hydroclimate than previous research suggests.

Heavy precipitation in Colorado is key to water resources. Just a few strong storms in a single water year can make or break the snowpack that delivers water to four major river basins across the U.S. However, predicting precipitation is challenging in this region because Colorado precipitation has high variability in space and time. One particular type of storm that results in heavy precipitation in the western U.S. is an atmospheric river (AR), a long and narrow region of intense water vapor transport in the atmosphere. However, as the moisture from the landfalling AR traverses inland to Colorado, the distance from the coast and the high and complex topography of the Rocky Mountains causes the moisture from the AR to break up and decrease dramatically, making it difficult to attribute ARs to precipitation in Colorado. This is evident from the relatively low frequency of AR detection overhead in Colorado using more traditional AR detection methods. However, a large volume of anecdotal evidence suggests that moisture from landfalling ARs is reaching Colorado and contributing significantly to precipitation. This work uses a novel, trajectory-based method to track air parcels associated with top-decile precipitation in Colorado back to the coast to determine if a landfalling AR was associated with that precipitation. We show that 10–70\% of top-decile precipitation, primarily in western Colorado, is associated with landfalling ARs, indicating a larger role for ARs to western Colorado precipitation and water supply.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Forecasting precipitation in Colorado (CO) is challenging due to its high spatio-temporal variability across the state \cite{Cowie1986ColoradoAnalysis, Kirk2018LargeBasin, Lute2014RoleStates, Serreze2001CharacteristicsData}. On the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains, a majority of the total annual precipitation falls during the winter months between November and February \cite{Doesken1984Period., Harvey2019CitizensFrom}. In southeastern CO, along the Front Range and in the Plains, most of the precipitation falls during summer convective storms, while a majority of the precipitation in northeastern CO falls during the spring months \cite{Doesken1984Period., Harvey2019CitizensFrom}. Even during one storm, there is often large variation in precipitation across short distances due to the high and complex topography of CO. \citeA{Serreze2001CharacteristicsData} found that on the western slopes of CO, less than 50\% of the time a heavy or extreme precipitation event occurs at one station, most of the other surrounding stations also experience a heavy precipitation event. Furthermore, single storm events can contribute significantly to total water year precipitation, as demonstrated by \citeA{Cowie1986ColoradoAnalysis, Kirk2018LargeBasin, Lute2014RoleStates} and \citeA{Serreze2001CharacteristicsData}.

% "Serreze et al.'s 2001 analysis of large snowfall events in the Western United States found that the largest snowfall event of each year contributed 10–23% of the annual snow water equivalent (SFE) at SNOTEL stations."

One type of storm that results in heavy precipitation across the western U.S. is an atmospheric river (AR). ARs are defined as long and narrow bands of intense water vapor transport, which may result in heavy precipitation when crossing from ocean to land (i.e., make landfall) or interacting with topographic barriers, \cite<e.g.,>[and others]{dettinger2016historical, Newell1994, Newell1992, Ralph2012}. While many studies show that ARs modulate extreme precipitation in multiple regions across the globe, there are few studies that demonstrate the high contribution to extreme and annual precipitation from ARs that penetrate inland and travel long distances \cite{Rutz2012, Rutz2014, Rutz2015, Nash2021, Nash2024InfluenceExtremes}. In particular, \citeA{Rutz2012} found that up to 10--30\% of cool-season (November to April) precipitation at CO SNOTEL stations occurred within a day of an AR crossing the U.S. West Coast between the latitudes of 24\textdegree N and 52.5\textdegree N. \citeA{Rutz2014} found that ARs occur directly over CO less than 5\% of the time (during cool-season months between 1988 and 2011) and contribute up to 15\% of cool-season precipitation. While the AR identification method in \citeA{Rutz2014} uses an absolute threshold for IVT (IVT $\geq$ 250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}), other AR detection tools that use percentile based thresholds (e.g., \citeA{Guan2015}, IVT $\geq$ 85th percentile) show similar results over western CO, where ARs occur less than 8\% of the time, and contribute 15--20\% of cool-season precipitation. 

However, collaboration with forecasters at the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Grand Junction, CO suggests that AR-related moisture reaches CO more frequently, and contributes to precipitation more significantly than previous research suggests, particularly in the case of heavy or extreme precipitation events (NWS Grand Junction, personal communication, 2023). This study aims to quantify the contribution of moisture associated with landfalling ARs to CO precipitation, without relying on overhead AR detection, which is plagued by many challenges over the high and complex topography of CO. Instead, this study uses backwards trajectory analysis to show there is a much higher frequency of AR-related moisture penetrating inland and triggering a precipitation response in CO. 

There have been efforts to better understand the relationship between landfalling ARs, moisture penetration into the Interior West, and precipitation, but these studies did not explicitly connect inland penetrating ARs to precipitation response in CO. \citeA{Rutz2015} used forward trajectory analysis to analyze the common pathways and characteristics of cool-season ARs that made landfall on the U.S. West Coast and penetrated inland. They found that the highest frequency of ARs that are able to do so make landfall north of 45\textdegree N along the U.S. West Coast and follow low-elevation corridors inland. They also found that although a smaller number of ARs make landfall on the Baja Peninsula, they have a higher success rate (52\% of the time) of penetrating inland compared to those that make landfall at higher latitudes (24--28\% of the time) \cite{Rutz2015}. However, that study did not attribute fraction of precipitation in Interior West locations associated with these tracked ARs, and furthermore, very few of the trajectories extended past 110\textdegree W. \citeA{Alexander2015} used backwards trajectory analysis to identify dominant moisture pathways during cool-season extreme precipitation events in the Intermountain West and found similar results to those of \citeA{Rutz2015}, but did not directly attribute precipitation to ARs. 

To address this, we combine the approaches of \citeA{Rutz2015} and \citeA{Alexander2015} to attribute moisture from landfalling ARs to top-decile ($>$ 90th percentile) precipitation across CO. We employ backwards trajectories from all subbasins in CO when daily precipitation exceeds the 90th percentile and determine if precipitation from a particular day was associated with a landfalling AR. Additionally, we determine the likely pathways of the AR-related moisture transport and show that there is a higher frequency of AR-related moisture penetrating inland and contributing to top-decile precipitation days than previously found. The organization of this paper is as follows: Section \ref{sec:data} describes the data used in this analysis and Section \ref{sec:methods} outlines the methodology used for the backwards trajectory analysis. Section \ref{sec:results:moisture_pathways} describes the moisture pathways of the AR-related precipitation days and Section \ref{sec:results:composite_analysis} shows the synoptic patterns when landfalling AR trajectories crossed certain regions. Section \ref{sec:results:contribution} quantifies the contribution of AR-related moisture to top-decile precipitation days across CO. Results, applications, and future directions are summarized in Section \ref{conclusions}. 

% Main Idea: When you identify ARs over CO using traditional ARDTs and considering the days when an AR is directly overhead, you get very few ARs per year (less than 1 per year); therefore the goal of this paper is to objectively identify moisture from ARs that is penetrating inland, reaching CO, and triggering a precipitation response. *** Present this as an existing paradox that needs explanation ***
% Introduce: Can reference studies (Rutz et al., 2014; Guan and Waliser, 2015; Guan and Waliser, 2022  (AR Scale/ARDT)) that show the frequency of ARs overhead in CO as very few. 
% Key Point: Describe the use of trajectory analysis and it’s benefits in tracking air parcels associated with precipitation (Find some more studies, but can reference the Alexander et al., 2018 paper) 
% Explain Key Point: This point needs to be made now because it sets up why we did what we did for our methods
% Connect: This key point connects to the main point because we can now show that there are actually a much higher frequency of AR-related moisture penetrating inland and triggering precipitation response. This has implications for weather forecasting (potential avenue to improve short term forecasting) as well as longer term hydroclimate implications (number of ARs per year influencing drought conditions)

% Motivation
% Quantify the precipitation contribution of AR moisture that reach CO
% Develop a methodology for attributing precipitation over the Western U.S. Interior to landfalling ARs along the U.S. West Coast and Gulf Coast and apply it to CO knowing that ARs break up and don’t meet traditional criteria by the time they reach CO

% Develop specialized AR-focused diagnostic and forecasting tools for the CO Front Range 
% Develop a tool and show it in use - for a single event




\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
\subsection{Colorado Watershed Boundaries}
To determine the contribution of AR-related moisture to extreme precipitation days in CO, we use the Watershed Boundary Dataset created by the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of Agriculture - Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The polygon-based dataset represents the hydrologic unit (HU) boundaries to the 8-digit (HUC8) and identifies 92 HUC8 subbasins (hereafter referred to as subbasins) that touch CO. Additionally, we show analysis at the region level, which indicates results for all subbasins (of the 92 analyzed) that share the first two digits of their HU code. For example, we summarize results for CO subbasins that fall within the Rio Grande Region (HUC2 13), which shows the results for the 7 subbasins whose first two digits of the HUC8 of are 13 (Upper Colorado Region HUC2 is 14, Missouri Region HUC2 is 10, and Arkansas Region HUC2 is 11).

\subsection{Reanalysis Data}

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalyses of the global climate (ERA5) at 1-h and  0.25\textdegree{} resolutions were used to examine geopotential height, winds, specific humidity at multiple pressure levels, as well as IVT \cite{Hersbach2020}. Zonal and meridional IVT were calculated by taking the 1-hourly reanalyses, interpolating u and v wind components (m s\textsuperscript{-1}), and water vapor mixing ratio (kg kg\textsuperscript{-1}) between 300 hPa and the surface (see \ref{appendix:ivt} for equations).

% The vertical fluxes of water vapor were calculated by multiplying the v (meridional) or u (zonal) component wind by specific humidity (q) at each pressure level (see Appendix \ref{appendix:wvf} for equations).

\subsection{Precipitation Data}

For precipitation, we generated daily time series for each subbasin, based on daily total precipitation (rain and melted snow) provided by the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). The daily total precipitation is area aggregated to the HUC8 subbasins from 1 Jan 2000 to 31 Dec 2023 where the 24-hour precipitation ends at 12 UTC of each day. Mean areal precipitation is calculated by identifying the latitude and longitude pairs on a 0.05\textdegree{} grid that fall in each subbasin and using bilinear interpolation to interpolate the PRISM 4-km grid to those points within the subbasin. The point values are then averaged within each subbasin, giving mean areal precipitation in mm per day. 

%% which PRISM dataset did Jay download? https://prism.oregonstate.edu/documents/PRISM_datasets.pdf

We used the distribution of precipitation values for each subbasin to determine the 90th percentile threshold, only considering days when precipitation is greater than 2.54 mm (0.1 inch). We calculated trajectories for all days in each subbasin where precipitation exceeded 90th percentile, hereafter referred to as top-decile precipitation days.


\subsection{AR Detection}

Three AR detection tools (ARDTs) were employed to detect ARs: (1) the Tracking Atmospheric Rivers Globally as Elongated Targets (tARget) algorithm version 4 was applied to global, 1-h, 0.25\textdegree{} horizontal resolution ERA5 from 1940 to 2023 \cite{Guan2024AERA5}. The tARget v4 uses a combination of geometry (e.g., length, width), relative IVT intensity thresholds (e.g., above 85th percentile of local climatological IVT), and directional components (e.g., must be poleward, not overly cyclonic, etc.) to detect AR objects. Additionally, tARget v4 is a combination of condition (meeting the threshold and geometry requirements) and tracking (AR object is followed across time and space) computation type. (2) the \citeA{Rutz2014} method was applied to global, 3-h, 0.5\textdegree{}x0.625\textdegree{} horizontal resolution Modern Era Retrospective Reanalysis Version 2 (MERRA2) from 1980 to 2023 (hereafter referred to as the Rutz ARDT) \cite{Bosilovich2015, Gelaro2017}. The Rutz ARDT uses a combination of geometry (length $>$ 2000 km) and absolute IVT intensity thresholds (e.g. greater than or equal to 250 kg m-1 s-1). (3) the AR Scale \cite{MartinRalph2019} was applied to global, 1-h, 0.25\textdegree{} horizontal resolution ERA5 from 2000 to 2023. The AR Scale identifies ARs using a point-based value of 1--5 based on the maximum IVT magnitude and the duration of IVT $\geq$ 250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1} at that point \cite{MartinRalph2019}. Points must sustain IVT $\geq$ 250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1} for at least 24 hours to be considered an AR Scale 1. 

Figure \ref{fig:ar_overhead} shows the frequency of overhead AR conditions in CO using the above-mentioned ARDTs. \citeA{Guan2024AERA5} tARgetv4 has the highest frequency at about 4--7\% of the time, which aligns well with relative threshold ARDTs being considered more permissive, particularly in areas like CO that have low climatological water vapor content \cite{Rutz2019ARTMIP}. The AR Scale and Rutz ARDT show similar AR frequencies at about 0--4\% of the time, with the highest frequency occurring in the southeastern region of the state. AR Scale 1 and AR Scale 2 are the highest frequency (not shown), with AR Scale 4 and 5 rarely, if ever, occurring. Note that while this is only a small selection of available ARDTs \cite<e.g.,>{Rutz2019ARTMIP, Shields2018AtmosphericDesign}, it does represent some of the least restrictive methods, and yet AR frequencies are very low.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}
\subsection{Backwards Trajectory Analysis}

To run the backwards trajectories, we use the simple lagrangian analysis employed in \citeA{Rutz2015} where the zonal, meridional, and vertical wind components from ERA5 data are trilinearly interpolated to determine the atmospheric data at each trajectory location for 72 hours at 1-h resolution. The $\sim$27-km horizontal resolution and 1-hr temporal resolution in ERA5 provides a reasonable estimate for the interpolated atmospheric data at each subsequent trajectory location.

We completed sensitivity tests on the grid points, height, and time of initialization conditions for four individual subbasins within each of the basins for four separate, top-decile precipitation days. Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_tests} shows the results of the varying initialization sensitivity tests for the 17--19 March 2003 storm that produced historical snowfall and significant impacts across CO \cite{Wesley2013Extreme2003}. \textbf{Grid Points:} The sensitivity test trajectories were initiated from the latitude and longitude of the centroid of the subbasin, plus at four points (N, S, E, W) that were 0.25\textdegree{} from the centroid (e.g., if the centroid of the subbasin was 107\textdegree W, 38\textdegree N, the additional initialization points were 107\textdegree W, 38.25\textdegree N, 107\textdegree W, 37.75\textdegree N, 106.75\textdegree W, 38\textdegree N, and 107.25\textdegree W, 38\textdegree N). There were few differences in the trajectories initialized from the different grid points; there were a few exceptions in the trajectories initialized from 600 hPa in the Arkansas Headwaters (southeastern CO) (Fig. \ref{fig:sensitivity_tests}e, g, and h), where some of the trajectories were sourced from more northerly flow while others followed a more southerly anticyclonic rotation. Likely these differences arose from differences in surface pressure from the different points, therefore, we chose to run all the trajectories from the centroid of each subbasin.

\textbf{Height:} In the vertical, we examined trajectories initiated on pressure levels from 500 hPa to 800 hPa at 100 hPa increments (e.g., 500, 600, 700, 800) (Fig. \ref{fig:sensitivity_tests}). The different initialization heights resulted in very different trajectory paths, as the parcel followed the synoptic patterns typical for that height. For example, the trajectories initialized from 500 hPa (Fig. \ref{fig:sensitivity_tests}a--d) exhibit more westerly flow, aligning with typical midlatitude 500 hPa wind patterns. On the other hand, below 700 hPa, 95\% of the trajectories come from the north, likely the barrier jet-like feature identified in \citeA{Wesley2013Extreme2003}. Due to the complex topography of CO and the varying results from the different initialization heights, we chose to initialize each trajectory at the single pressure level between 50 and 100 hPa above (at a lower pressure than) the surface. For example, at the grid point closest to the centroid of any given subbasin, if the surface pressure was 827 hPa, the trajectory for that subbasin was initialized from 750 hPa. Meanwhile, at the grid point closest to the centroid of any given subbasin, if the surface pressure was 967, the trajectory for that subbasin was initialized from 850 hPa. This methodology, similarly employed by \citeA{Alexander2015}, initializes trajectories high enough so that the majority of the trajectories remained above the surface over North America, but was low enough to be located within the region of strong water vapor transport (i.e., between 1000 and 300 hPa). 

\textbf{Time:} Since the PRISM daily precipitation data is centered on 00 UTC of each day, the sensitivity test trajectories were initialized at 12 and 18 UTC of the previous day, plus 00, and 06 UTC of the top-decile precipitation day. There were few differences in trajectories initialized at different times in the 24-hour period of precipitation accumulation; therefore, we chose to initialize all of our trajectories from 00 UTC to center them in the middle of the 24-hour precipitation accumulation period.

\label{fig:sensitivity_tests}
\end{figure}

\subsection{AR Conditions at the Coast}
\label{sec:methods:ar_conditions}
To determine whether any given top-decile precipitation day was associated with a landfalling AR, we evaluated the AR conditions when the trajectory crossed the coast of North America. We tested multiple ARDTs including the \citeA{Guan2024AERA5} tARget v4 ARDT, the AR Scale using ERA5 data \cite{MartinRalph2019}, and the \citeA{Rutz2014} ARDT. Section \ref{sec:results:contribution} and Figure \ref{fig:choropleth} highlight the key differences between the ARDTs. One key future outcome from this study is a forecast tool assessing the relationship between AR magnitude at the coast and CO precipitation. Because the AR Scale readily lends itself to quick forecast utility (i.e., the AR Scale is less computationally expensive than an ARDT), we share the results based on the AR Scale using ERA5 data for the remainder of the paper \cite{MartinRalph2019}.

We also tested multiple spatio-temporal criteria for determining whether a trajectory was associated with a landfalling AR. For example, we utilized “strict” requirements for associating a trajectory with a landfalling AR. The strict method required that an AR had to be present at the hour and the same grid cell when the trajectory crossed the coast, and the height of the trajectory needed to fall at or below 700 hPa. With the strict methodology, 1314 of the 11493 trajectories for the 92 subbasins were associated with a landfalling AR. On the other hand, we used “flexible” criteria to determine whether any given trajectory was associated with a landfalling AR. The flexible criteria required that an AR had to be present within 24 hours ($\pm$ 12 hours from when the trajectory crossed the coast), in any grid cell within 2.25 degrees ($\pm$ 1 degree from the grid where the trajectory crossed the coast), and the height of the trajectory needed to fall at or below 700 hPa. With the flexible methodology, 2834 of the 11493 trajectories for the 92 subbasins were associated with a landfalling AR. We utilize the flexible requirements for this analysis based on the notion that trajectories satisfying these criteria are \textit{unlikely} to be \textit{unrelated} to the AR identified near the coast. Furthermore, based on our sensitivity tests on initialization conditions, even minor changes in these conditions can result in a different end point for the trajectory. Therefore, the flexible requirements better represent the likelihood that AR-related moisture located within a few degrees of the parcel was able to penetrate inland and reach CO, contributing to precipitation. For the remainder of this study, we refer to the top-decile precipitation trajectories associated with landfalling ARs based on the flexible criteria as "landfalling AR trajectories".

% Main Idea: The main idea for this section is to show the common pathways for moisture to be able to penetrate inland and make it to CO. What are the common paths? What does the vertical structure of the moisture flux look like when it crosses complex topographic areas of interest?
% Introduce: Understanding the moisture paths of the inland penetrating moisture will help us understand the paths more likely to be taken - when forecasts show that ARs are likely to take these paths, we will have a better idea of upcoming precipitation patterns. 
% Key Point: Describe the pathways of moisture using Figure 5 for the different basins and the average IVT as each trajectory passes through (Figure 6).
% Explain Key Point: This will have discussions on the higher frequency of the moisture paths for each basin and what season/time of year is more likely for these paths.
% Connect: We can show that the pathways are very similar to those outlined in Rutz et al., 2015 - however the trajectories from that work did not quite extend to CO - this work is confirming the pathways and the relationship to top-decile precipitation.
% Next Key Point: Now that we have the horizontal pathways described, we now will show the vertical pathway composites over a few topographic areas of interest (e.g., where the horizontal pathways are common and there are topographic barriers) (Figure 7)
% Explain Key Point: The vertical pathway composites will show the frequency of the trajectories in the vertical along different topographic barriers of interest. This will give us a better understanding of how the moisture is able to continue penetrating inland - is it along a valley? Is the moisture much higher at a certain point because it has been lifted?
% Connect: This section will give us a better understanding of the vertical structure of the moisture as it penetrates inland.

For all top-decile precipitation days in each of the 92 subbasins in CO, we applied the backwards trajectory analysis as outlined in Section \ref{sec:methods} and then determined AR conditions at the coast using three different ARDTs: tARgetv4, Rutz ARDT, and ERA5 AR Scale \cite{MartinRalph2019, Rutz2014, Guan2024AERA5}. We show the common pathways of landfalling AR trajectories (ERA5 AR Scale) and top-decile CO precipitation. To better summarize our findings, we group the subbasins into their regional basins. CO has 4 regional basins: Upper Colorado, Rio Grande, Missouri, and Arkansas (see Fig. \ref{fig:ar_overhead} for the extent of each region). We also differentiate between trajectories that occur in the cool-season months (i.e., November 1 through April 30) and warm-season months (i.e., May 1 through October 31). Figures S1 through S2 and S6 through S9 show the results differentiated by the three-month seasons (e.g. December through February, March through May, June through August, and September through November).

\subsection{Moisture Pathways for Inland Penetrating ARs}
\label{sec:results:moisture_pathways}

Figure \ref{fig:spaghetti_plot} shows the landfalling AR trajectories, with the colors indicating the ERA5 AR scale value when the trajectory crosses the coast. The Upper Colorado region has, by far, the most landfalling AR trajectories. Of the 4381 trajectories ran for the 33 subbasins, 54\% of the cool-season trajectories and 31\% of the warm-season trajectories were associated with landfalling ARs. In the cool-season, AR scale 1 and 2 are the most common with 705 and 360 trajectories, while there were 122, 16, and 3 trajectories associated with AR scale 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The warm-season had a similar number of AR Scale 1 and 2 trajectories (655 and 481), but there were only 42 trajectories associated with AR scale 3, 4, and 5. Through visual inspection, most of the trajectories from the Upper Colorado region crossed the west coast of North America in both the cool-season and warm-season. Less than 10 trajectories in the Upper Colorado region crossed the Gulf of Mexico Coast during the cool-season, and about 20 during the warm-season. In the warm-season, there were 7 landfalling AR Scale 4 or 5 trajectories initialized on 27 October 2021 that made landfall on the northern and central California coast, passed through southern Idaho and northern Utah before reaching the Upper Colorado region. This storm was one of the first significant snows of water year 2022 following the exceptional drought during water year 2021 \cite{Bolinger2023ClimateEdition}. Significant storm events in the shoulder seasons (e.g., SON, MAM) are critical to CO water resources as they can significantly modify changes in snowpack timing \cite{Heldmyer2023ABasin}. Future work should attempt to better understand the relationship between landfalling ARs and their impacts on CO precipitation during the shoulder seasons.

The Rio Grande region had the second most landfalling ARs trajectories. Of the 848 trajectories for the 7 subbasins, 54\% of the cool-season trajectories and 23\% of the warm-season trajectories were associated with landfalling ARs. In the cool-season, AR scale 1 and 2 are the most common with 241 and 135 trajectories, while there were 71, 28, and 7 trajectories associated with AR scale 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The warm-season had 92 and 63 AR Scale 1 and 2 trajectories, but there were only 4 trajectories associated with AR scale 3, and none associated with AR Scale 4 and 5. Similar to the Upper Colorado region, most of the trajectories crossed the west coast of North America in both the cool-season and warm-season, but primarily the coasts of Southern California and the Baja Peninsula. 

The Missouri region had the third most landfalling AR trajectories. Of the 646 trajectories for the 31 subbasins, 14\% of the cool-season trajectories and 7\% of the warm-season trajectories were associated with landfalling ARs. In the cool-season, AR scale 1 and 2 are the most common with 90 and 41 trajectories, while there were 11, 1, and 1 trajectories associated with AR scale 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The warm-season had 134 and 57 AR Scale 1 and 2 trajectories, but there were only 10 trajectories associated with AR scale 3 and 4, and none associated with AR Scale 5. Most of the trajectories crossed the west coast of North America in the cool-season, but there was a higher frequency of trajectories that crossed the Gulf of Mexico during the warm-season.

In the Arkansas region, of the 2353 trajectories for the 21 subbasins, 8\% of the cool-season trajectories and 14\% of the warm-season trajectories were associated with landfalling ARs. In the cool-season, AR scale 1 and 2 were the most common with 33 and 7 trajectories, while there were 2 trajectories associated with AR scale 3 and 4, and none associated with AR Scale 5. The warm-season had 161 and 52 AR Scale 1 and 2 trajectories, while there were 22, 2, and 8 trajectories associated with AR scale 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Most of the trajectories crossed the Gulf of Mexico during both the cool- and warm-seasons, with a notable number of AR Scale 5 events during the warm-season. Due to the higher amount of water vapor flux in the Gulf of Mexico during the warmer months, it is not a surprise to see a higher frequency of events associated with an AR Scale 5. However, because the AR Scale is calculated based on IVT conditions at a single grid cell over time, it is difficult to ascertain that those events were associated with AR that meet the criteria of a stricter ARDT employing geometric criteria.

\end{figure}


To show the preferred pathways of landfalling AR trajectories, Figure \ref{fig:heatmaps} shows the frequency of trajectories passing through a grid, again broken down by region and warm or cool-season, similar to Fig. \ref{fig:spaghetti_plot}. In the Upper Colorado region, the dominant pathway for the trajectories in the cool-season is to enter via the southern California or the Baja Peninsula coasts, then cross Arizona and enter CO via the Four Corners region. There are also quite a few trajectories that appear to enter via the Gulf of California. During the warm-season, the preferred pathway is to enter via the Gulf of California, then similarly to the cool-season, across Arizona, and entering CO through the Four Corners region. 

In the Rio Grande region, the preferred pathway during the cool-season is similar to that of the Upper Colorado region, albeit with less frequency overall, and very few trajectories crossing the southern California coast. During the warm-season, the pathway is again similar to that of the Upper Colorado region, however with a lower frequency. Additionally, there is a higher frequency of trajectories coming in from the Gulf of Mexico coast along the southern border of Texas, crossing New Mexico and entering CO in the southcentral part of the state. 

In the Missouri region during the cool-season, there is a higher frequency of trajectories entering around southern California and the northern Baja Peninsula. Some of the trajectories cross Arizona, but it appears the preferred pathway is across central Utah and northern CO before reaching the Missouri region. Most of the landfalling AR trajectories that reach the Missouri region during the cool-season are concentrated in the western subbasins (e.g., North Platte Headwaters and Upper North Platte subbasins) which are still located in the Rocky Mountains. The complex terrain of these areas is likely why there are fewer trajectories overall that reach the Missouri region during the cool-season, as the water vapor flux likely is reduced dramatically as it is forced to ascend these ranges.  The Missouri region sees a higher frequency of trajectories during the warmer months, with most originating near the Gulf of Mexico coast, crossing Texas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska, before moving west into the Missouri region. This pathway aligns with some of the historically significant storms that occurred during the spring months along the Front Range, including the March 2003 Blizzard (see Fig. \ref{fig:sensitivity_tests}) and the March 2019 Bomb Cyclone \cite{Zou2024A2019}. 

There are so few landfalling AR trajectories in the Arkansas region during the cool-season that it is difficult to pin down a preferred pathway. However, during the warm-season, the preferred trajectory pathway is very similar to that of the Missouri region during the warm-season, again, aligning well with the known synoptic patterns of historically significant spring storms, but also the synoptic patterns associated with summertime short duration convective storms that often get their moisture from the Great Plains low-level jet \cite{Helfand1995ClimatologyStates, Pu2016DynamicalPrecipitation,  Schubert1998SubseasonalStates, Weaver2008VariabilityImpacts}.

Preferred pathways for trajectories not associated with landfalling ARs (Fig. S3) appear to have more spatial variability than the landfalling AR trajectories. It is likely that most of these trajectories were not associated with a landfalling AR because they did not cross the coast. For those that did cross the coast, it is possible that with less strict requirements to associate them with an AR, more trajectories would be associated with landfalling ARs (i.e., considering landfalling ARs within 5 degrees of the trajectory crossing the coast, see Section \ref{sec:methods:ar_conditions} for more details).

\subsection{Horizontal Composites for Inland Penetrating ARs}
\label{sec:results:composite_analysis}

Synoptic conditions associated with CO inland-penetrating ARs are characterized by performing composites of daily-mean IVT (kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}) (Fig. \ref{fig:composites_NDJFMA}a,c,e and \ref{fig:composites_MJJASO}a,c,e), daily-mean IVT anomalies (annual cycle removed) (Fig. \ref{fig:composites_NDJFMA}b,d,f and \ref{fig:composites_MJJASO}b,d,f), and 700 hPa geopotential heights (m). The composites are divided into cool- and warm-seasons and dates are chosen for each composite when any of the trajectories for any of the CO subbasins are associated with a landfalling AR and pass through the indicated red bounding box in each figure. The bounding boxes were chosen based on the high frequency of trajectories identified in Fig. \ref{fig:heatmaps}. To test the difference of the means of IVT and 700 hPa geopotential height anomalies, we use the one-sample t-test to test if the average anomalies are significantly different from zero \cite{WILKS2019ch5statistics}. 

%% PNW

Landfalling AR trajectories that cross the Pacific Northwest during the cool-season (Fig. \ref{fig:composites_NDJFMA}a,b) are associated with westerly IVT (200--300 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}) coming out of the North Pacific near the Pacific Northwest Coast. The higher IVT during these landfalling AR trajectories relative to the other regions is likely why the majority of the AR Scale 4 and 5 events occur in this region (Fig. \ref{fig:spaghetti_plot}). These events occur, on average, less than 7 days per year, aligning well with Regime 1 described in \citeA{Rutz2015}, which notes that less than 7\% of those ARs making landfall on the Pacific Northwest Coast are able to penetrate into the Interior West \cite{Rutz2015}. During the warm-season (Fig. \ref{fig:composites_MJJASO}a,b), trajectories are associated with northwesterly IVT in the North Pacific (200--350 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}). As the moisture penetrates inland, the moisture flux shifts to a more westerly direction, although compared to the cool-season synoptic patterns for the Pacific Northwest (Fig. \ref{fig:composites_NDJFMA}b), the anomalous IVT does not extend as far inland. Composites showing 24 hours after the trajectory is within the Pacific Northwest domain show the development of a cutoff low, indicating that the extra dynamic development may be needed to help with precipitation response in CO (Fig. S5a,b).

%%  Baja
Landfalling AR trajectories that cross Southern California and the Baja Peninsula during the cool-season (Fig. \ref{fig:composites_NDJFMA}c,d) are associated with anomalously low 700 hPa heights centered at 125\textdegree W and 40\textdegree N, an elongated region of northwesterly IVT $\geq$ 200 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1} extending across the Northern Pacific, and enhanced IVT (150--200 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}) along the west coast of North America from southern Oregon to the Baja Peninsula. Once past the coast, southwesterly IVT ranges between 100--150 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}. Over the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern U.S., anticyclonic IVT (150--250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}) introduces moisture into Texas, but the flow is primarily southwesterly, resulting in a negative anomaly. This synoptic pattern aligns well with Regime 3 described in \citeA{Rutz2015} and indicates that ARs making landfall on the southern coast of North America are able to penetrate inland to CO at a higher frequency. Additionally, composites showing 24 hours after the trajectory is within the Baja domain indicate that there is very little IVT depletion over Southern California and the Baja Peninsula, as IVT remains between 150--200 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1} (Fig. S5c,d). During the warm-season (Fig. \ref{fig:composites_MJJASO}c,d), the anomalously low 700 hPa height center is shifted east to 120\textdegree W and 40\textdegree N and drives southwesterly IVT (150--200 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}) coming out of the Gulf of California. These conditions align well with the Gulf of California moisture surge that typically occurs during the warmer months and North American Monsoon, where moisture is brought from the Gulf of California into Arizona, resulting in convective thunderstorms across the Southwest U.S. \cite{Higgins2004RelationshipsStates}. These trajectories are also associated with anticyclonic IVT (150--250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}) out of the Gulf of Mexico that extends northward along the Great Plains, although it is only significantly above average in northern Texas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska. 


% AR trajectories move northeastward into the south-
% western United States, often exhibiting weak cyclonic
% (anticyclonic) curvature farther northwest (south-
% east). Although trajectories within this regime typi-
% cally have smaller water vapor ﬂuxes near the coast
% than those farther north, most experience limited
% amounts of water vapor depletion over the mountains
% of Southern California and the Baja Peninsula (some
% experience increases over the Gulf of California)

%% Four Corners
For landfalling AR trajectories that crossed the Four Corners region during the cool-season (Fig. \ref{fig:composites_NDJFMA}e,f), the synoptic conditions are similar to those in Fig. \ref{fig:composites_NDJFMA}c,d, except that the anomalously low 700 hPa heights are centered at 115\textdegree W and 40\textdegree N. However, unlike trajectories that cross the Baja, there is anomalous southeasterly, anticyclonic IVT (150--300 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}, 50 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1} above average) coming out of the Gulf of Mexico, likely initiated by falling heights across the southwestern U.S. While some of that anomalous moisture flows towards the northeast U.S., some of the moisture wrapped cyclonically around the low, potentially allowing it to move into CO. Notably, the daily-mean IVT and anomaly composites for this pattern are strikingly similar to those for 24 hours after landfalling ARs near southern California and the northern Baja Peninsula (Fig. S4c,d), suggesting that many trajectories for those locations and the Four Corners are the same, but offset by $\sim$1 day. This is also supported by the eastward progression of lower 700 hPa heights. During the warm-season (Fig. \ref{fig:composites_MJJASO}e,f), synoptic conditions for trajectories are similar to those of warm-season trajectories that cross the Baja Peninsula (Fig. \ref{fig:composites_MJJASO}c,d), although the Gulf of California moisture surge is weaker, and the Gulf of Mexico moisture is stronger. Additionally, the anomalously low 700 hPa heights have shifted to 115\textdegree W and 38\textdegree N. 

%% Gulf of Mexico
Less than 27 landfalling AR trajectories crossed the Gulf of Mexico during the cool-season (Fig. \ref{fig:composites_NDJFMA}g,h). Landfalling AR trajectories that crossed the Gulf of Mexico along the southern border of Texas are associated with southerly IVT (150--250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1} and anomalously low 700 hPa heights centered at 120\textdegree W and 35\textdegree N. The moisture primarily enters the Great Plains, while in eastern Texas, IVT is about 90 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1} below average. Twenty-four hours after the trajectories cross the coast near the Gulf of Mexico, the southerly moisture plume coming out of the Gulf of Mexico is stronger and extends further north to North and South Dakota (Fig. S4g,h). Additionally, the anomalously low 700 hPa heights deepened by 2 hPa and shifted south and eastward, centered at 115\textdegree W and 32\textdegree N. This results in IVT along the Great Plains wrapping cyclonically around the low, likely resulting in easterly low-level moisture flux that is common in significant precipitation events along the Front Range such as the March 2003 and 2019 storms \cite{Wesley2013Extreme2003, Zou2024A2019}. During the warm-season (Fig. \ref{fig:composites_MJJASO}e,f), the composite shows a slight trough at 700 hPa centered on 120\textdegree W and 35\textdegree N and a prominent plume of anticyclonic IVT (200--350 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}) coming out of the Gulf of Mexico that extends northward through the central U.S. This pattern aligns with conditions during the Great Plains low-level jet, which, when present, affects the variability of warm-season precipitation over the central U.S. and Midwest \cite{Pu2016DynamicalPrecipitation, Helfand1995ClimatologyStates, Weaver2008VariabilityImpacts, Schubert1998SubseasonalStates}. Multiple studies have shown that the anomalous moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico is associated with severe floods \cite{Mo1997AtmosphericStates, Weaver2009PentadBalance}. More recently, a study completed by \citeA{Gyawali2023AStates} found that 36\% of the time there was a Great Plains low-level jet (April--September, 1901--2010), an AR was also present. Additionally, they found that Great Plains low-level jet days that occurred simultaneously with an AR saw 34\% greater 850 hPa windspeeds, 53\% greater IVT, and 72\% greater 24-h precipitation accumulation compared to Great Plains low-level jet days not associated with an AR. While those statistics are specific to the Great Plains region, they show that CO sees precipitation 2--3 mm day\textsuperscript{-1} above average during Great Plains low-level jet days that are also associated with an AR. It is very likely that during the warm-season, AR days associated with the Great Plains low-level jet influence top-decile precipitation in CO.

\subsection{Contribution of AR-related Moisture to Top-Decile Precipitation events across Colorado}
\label{sec:results:contribution}
% Main Idea: This section will describe the contribution (average and interannual variation) of AR moisture to top-decile precipitation events across CO
% Introduce: Using the above-defined methodology for backwards trajectory analysis and determining if each trajectory was associated with an AR when it crossed the coast or not, Figure 3 shows the fraction of top-decile precipitation associated with landfalling AR moisture. 
% Key Point: Describe the results of the various ARDTs
% Explain Key Point: This point needs to be made to show that even with varying ARDTs, the results are consistent. Then describe the patterns of fraction of contribution with an emphasis on NW, SW, NE, SE CO
% Connect: This map directly represents the total top-decile precipitation contribution by moisture associated with ARs between 2000 and 2023 for each subbasin. 
% Next Key Point: Compare the results to those found in Rutz et al. 2015
% Explain Key Point: The results we have show a higher fraction of contribution - this aligns with anecdotal evidence from NWS and shows that this is a useful methodology for identifying AR moisture penetrating inland in locations that do not see as much AR activity. Additionally, add a sentence or two about the SNOTEL station result in the Four Corners in Rutz et al. 2015 and how that aligns very well with what our results show.
% Connect: This shows that our methodology is an improvement, but also still aligns well with previous research - this methodology could be used elsewhere and is needed in CO.
% Next Key Point: Describe the number of trajectories associated with a landfalling atmospheric river (Figure 4)
% Explain Key Point: This result shows the paths and AR scale value associated with the trajectories that did cross the coast broken down by season - this gives us a general number per year of top-decile precipitation days associated with atmospheric river moisture and starts to give us an idea of the paths moisture takes for the different basins across CO
% Connect: This shows when AR associated moisture is more frequent for each basin in CO as well as starts to show the paths that they take (i.e., winter westerly trajectories more common for western CO while summer southeasterly trajectories are more common for eastern CO)

\label{fig:choropleth}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:choropleth} shows the average fraction of top-decile precipitation associated with landfalling ARs for each of the different ARDTs and their coefficient of variation for contributions from water year to water year. Before diving into each regional watershed, it is worth noting the huge gradient in this fraction that exists across the Continental Divide. This extreme gradient was not evident in previous studies because of their reliance on overhead ARs for attribution of precipitation \cite<e.g.,>{Rutz2014, Guan2015}. The \citeA{Rutz2014} ARDT had the least number of landfalling ARs considered to be associated with precipitation in subbasins in western CO, likely due the ARDT being based on an absolute IVT threshold, as well as geometry requirements. The \cite{Guan2024AERA5} tARget v4 ARDT had the next highest number of landfalling ARs associated with precipitation in subbasins in western CO, likely due to the ARDT being based on a relative IVT threshold, rather than an absolute. On the other hand, subbasins in southeastern CO had a higher number of landfalling ARs associated with precipitation from the \citeA{Rutz2014} ARDT compared to the \cite{Guan2024AERA5} tARget v4 ARDT, as a minimum absolute threshold of IVT $\geq$ 250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1} occurs more frequently over the Gulf of Mexico due to the higher climatological water vapor content. The majority of landfalling AR trajectories from subbasins in southeastern CO were tracked back to the Gulf of Mexico (see Section \ref{sec:results:moisture_pathways} for more discussion). Overall in CO, the AR Scale using ERA5 data \cite{MartinRalph2019} had the highest number of landfalling ARs associated with precipitation in CO subbasins, likely due to a lack of geometric requirements for detecting ARs. 

%% sentences about the higher fraction located in western CO
In western CO, in the Upper Colorado and Rio Grande Regions, moisture from landfalling ARs is associated with 10--70\% of top-decile precipitation, with the highest fractions occurring in southwestern CO subbasins in, or adjacent to, the San Juan Mountains (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}a--c). The subbasins with the highest contribution are the Animas subbasin with 69.4\%, Conejos subbasin with 60.3\%, and Upper Dolores subbasin with 59.5\%, all of which feature favorable topographic orientation for intercepting climatological moisture flux from the southwest (Fig. \ref{fig:heatmaps}). In the Rio Grande Headwaters, the contribution is 65.4\%, a much higher fraction than the 0--30\% of contribution that \citeA[Fig. 11b]{Rutz2014} found in southwestern CO. The differences between these results arises because \citeA{Rutz2014} calculates the fraction of top-decile precipitation associated with ARs directly overhead using the Rutz ARDT, which has geometry requirements and an absolute IVT threshold of 250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}. IVT in western CO averages around 100 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1} and peaks around 500 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}, therefore, it would be rare for IVT to exceed 250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}, let alone an AR maintain its shape long enough across western CO to meet the geometry requirements.

In the Rio Grande Headwaters, there was very little variability in the fraction of top-decile AR precipitation between the tARgetv4 and AR Scale ARDTs where the fraction was about 63\% and 65\%, respectively, while the fraction for the Rutz ARDT was much lower at 47\% (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}a--c). For more discussion on the differences in the ARDTs, see Sections \ref{sec:data} and \ref{sec:methods:ar_conditions}. The water year coefficient of variability ranged from 0.3 (based on AR Scale ARDT, Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}e) to 0.4 (based on Rutz ARDT, Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}f) in the Rio Grande subbasin.

In northwestern CO, landfalling AR moisture is associated with 20--50\% of the total top-decile precipitation, with about 35\% in the Upper Yampa subbasin (white outline in northwest CO). There is little variation between the different ARDTs and the fraction of AR-related top-decile precipitation. In the Upper Yampa subbasin, the tARgetv4 and Rutz ARDTs found the lower fraction of top-decile AR-related precipitation at 25\% and 27\%, respectively (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}a, c), while the AR Scale ARDT fraction was higher at 35\% (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}b). For year-to-year variability, the coefficient of variability ranged from 0.3 (based on AR Scale ARDT, Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}e) to 0.4 (based on tARgetv4 ARDT, Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}d) in the Upper Yampa subbasin.

Contributions are lower in eastern CO, ranging from 0--40\%. In northeastern CO, in the Upper South Platte subbasin, contributions from ARs to top-decile precipitation are less than 5\%, but there is some variability between ARDTs (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}a--c). The Rutz ARDT identified the lowest fraction at 0.6\% (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}c), tARget at 2.5\% (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}a), and the AR Scale at 4\% (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}b). However, there is very little water year variability in the Upper South Platte, with coefficients from the different ARDTs ranging from 0--0.2 (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}d--f). In the 23-year period, there were only five landfalling AR trajectories in the Upper South Platte that occurred during water years 2017 and 2023. 

Southeastern CO sees a higher contribution over a larger area than northeastern CO, with 10--40\% of top-decile precipitation associated with landfalling AR moisture (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}a--c). Most of the higher values ($\sim$40\%) are in far southeastern CO and quite clearly more related to events sourced from the Gulf of Mexico than the Pacific. There was very little variability between ARDTs in the fraction of top-decile AR-related precipitation in the Arkansas Headwaters subbasin, where the tARgetv4 and Rutz ARDTs found a slightly lower fraction of top-decile AR-related precipitation at 8.5\% and 8\%, respectively (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}a, c), compared to the AR Scale ARDT fraction at 9.5\% (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}b). Most of the variability between the ARDTs occurs in the most southeasterly subbasins in CO, with tARgetv4 identifying a lower contribution than Rutz ARDT and the AR Scale (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}d--f).

This is likely because the main difference between the ARDTs is that tARgetv4 uses a relative, percentile-based threshold for determining the minimum IVT value to be considered part of an AR and Rutz ARDT and ERA5 use an absolute threshold of 250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}. Since a large fraction of the trajectories in southeastern CO sourced moisture from the Gulf of Mexico (see Section \ref{sec:results:moisture_pathways} for more discussion on the moisture pathways), a relative threshold like the one used in tARgetv4 is likely to detect fewer ARs, while an absolute threshold will detect more ARs because climatological IVT values are much higher. In northeastern CO, only two subbasins located in the far northeastern region of the state see contributions higher than 10\%. 

Water year variability coefficients are some of the highest in the Arkansas Headwaters subbasin, ranging from 0.5 (tARgetv4 and AR Scale, Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}d, e) to 0.6 (Rutz ARDT, Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}f). This is likely because extreme precipitation in the Arkansas River basin falls primarily during convective storms in warm-season months and has high spatial heterogeneity due to complex terrain \cite{Javier2007ClimatologyBasin}.

Figure \ref{fig:time_series} shows the top-decile precipitation within each water year (WY) for the Upper Yampa, Rio Grande Headwaters, Upper South Platte, and the Arkansas Headwaters subbasins and compares them to the contribution associated with landfalling ARs. Notably, this fraction is higher in the Upper Yampa (10--54\%) and Rio Grande Headwaters (31--100\%) subbasins compared to the Upper South Platte (14--20\%) and Arkansas Headwaters (11-25\%) subbasins. Additionally, there are more years in the eastern subbasins where there is a 0\% contribution from landfalling ARs to top-decile precipitation, whereas in the Upper Yampa there are 3 years with a 0\% contribution and no years in the Rio Grande Headwaters subbasin. The average amount of top-decile precipitation associated with landfalling ARs ranges from just below  $\sim$25 mm per year in the Upper Yampa, Upper South Platte, and Arkansas Headwaters subbasin to $\sim$90 mm per year in the Rio Grande Headwaters subbasin. From year to year, there is high variability in top-decile precipitation across all the subbasins. For example, in the Rio Grande Headwaters, the years 2002 and 2018 saw only  $\sim$30 mm of top-decile precipitation, while 2005 and 2008 saw  $\sim$250 mm. \citeA{Lute2014RoleStates} suggest that the high variability in the fraction of top-decile precipitation from water year to water year in the Upper Yampa and Rio Grande subbasins is likely due to the high elevation of these regions and most of the precipitation accumulation occurring during winter months. This large interannual variability likely results from differences in mean cool-season storm track along the U.S. West Coast – AR landfalls in southern California and the Baja Peninsula are climatologically rare, but when favored by a more southerly storm track, they have a high likelihood of penetrating inland and delivering heavy precipitation to southwestern CO \cite{Rutz2014, Rutz2015}.

This study examines the relationship between landfalling atmospheric rivers (ARs), their inland penetration toward Colorado (CO), and top-decile precipitation across the state, with a focus on the 92 HUC8 subbasins and four regions they are located within (Upper Colorado, Rio Grande, Missouri, and Arkansas). Understanding the impact of ARs as they make their way inland is a relatively new area of research, but previous literature suggests their contribution to CO precipitation is maximized at $\sim$30\% in southwestern CO and much smaller elsewhere \cite<e.g.,>{Rutz2014, Guan2015}. However, both \citeA{Rutz2014} and \citeA{Guan2015} utilize geometric requirements that have limitations over the Interior West, areas where ARs are typically breaking up and decaying. Rather than attempting to spatially identify and track the inland penetration of ARs, which faces many challenges over high and complex topography, this study takes the novel approach of using backward trajectories from heavy precipitation events and their overlap with landfalling ARs as a proxy for inland penetration of AR-related moisture. This approach allows us to roughly estimate how much precipitation is related to moisture sourced from landfalling ARs.

While there are many types of storms that impact CO (e.g., winter and spring cyclones, summer convective systems), one storm that has been shown to influence precipitation in the Western U.S. are ARs. Understanding the impact of ARs as they make their way inland is a relatively new area of research, but inland-penetrating ARs have been shown to contribute up to 30\% of cool-season precipitation in southwestern CO \cite{Rutz2014}. However, one caveat of \citeA{Rutz2014} is that it identified ARs using a more traditional overhead approach, utilizing both geometry requirements (e.g., length and width) and an absolute IVT threshold (IVT $geq$ 250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}). CO is a very dry region, with climatological IVT averaging around 100 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}, meaning that traditional overhead AR detection methods do not capture the full contribution of AR-related moisture to precipitation. 

More specifically, this study uses backwards trajectories from all subbasins in CO when daily precipitation exceeds the 90th percentile to determine the fraction of top-decile precipitation associated with a landfalling AR. We show that there is a higher frequency of AR-related moisture contributing to top-decile precipitation days (10--70\%) than previously found. Using the trajectory results, we highlight the primary pathways of the AR-related moisture transport as it penetrates inland. The majority of landfalling AR trajectories cross the southern coast of North America (Southern California and the Baja Peninsula) during the cool-season, although there are many such trajectories that enter via the Gulf of Mexico Coast, primarily during the warm-season. These do not necessarily represent features traditionally thought of as ARs, but nonetheless represent significant water vapor transport northward towards CO.

Furthermore, this study describes the typical synoptic-scale patterns (via 700 hPa heights and IVT) for three areas that landfalling AR trajectories frequently cross (e.g., Baja Peninsula, Four Corners and San Juan Mountains, and the Gulf of Mexico). These patterns are primarily characterized by anomalously low 700 hPa heights centered over the western U.S., cyclonic IVT coming in from the Northern Pacific and Gulf of California (for Baja Peninsula and Four Corners trajectories), and anti-cyclonic IVT coming in from the Gulf of Mexico (for Gulf of Mexico trajectories). These composites, combined with information gleaned from the trajectory pathways results above, allow us to highlight the following key points:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The novel approach of using backwards trajectories for attributing precipitation to landfalling ARs yields higher AR contributions to top-decile precipitation events across CO (10-70\%) than previous studies (max $\sim$30\%). ARs routinely decay across the Interior West, making identification and tracking of their remnants, as well as attributable precipitation, difficult to achieve. \textit{It is likely that applying this method to other areas of high and complex topography globally will also yield higher contributions to both top-decile and total precipitation attributable to distantly landfalling ARs.}
  \item The vast majority of AR-related precipitation across portions of CO located west of the Continental Divide (i.e., where most seasonal snowpack is accumulated and stored) is sourced from ARs making landfall near Southern California and the Baja Peninsula. \textit{Since landfalling ARs here are climatologically rare, this result implies that minor changes in storm track and AR frequency across this area could produce outsized changes in western CO precipitation and water supply.}
  \item Many top-decile events along and near the CO Front Range are associated with trajectories originating in or near the Gulf of Mexico Coast, particularly near the US/Mexico border. The seasonality of these events suggests the pressure-driven low-level jet is playing a more significant role here than traditional AR processes. \textit{Future work should attempt to better understand and distinguish between these two sets of processes and their impacts on CO precipitation.}
\end{enumerate}

This study provides an assessment of the number of landfalling AR trajectories and specifically details the ERA5 AR Scale \cite{MartinRalph2019} value when the trajectory crossed the coast. This is particularly useful for future work, which plans to develop a forecast tool that provides the probability of CO subbasin precipitation and amounts based on the location and AR Scale value of landfalling ARs. The tool, currently being developed in collaboration with the National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast office in Grand Junction will serve as a situational awareness tool, providing forecasters with an estimate of precipitation based on historical top-decile precipitation events and their associated landfalling AR. This will allow NWS Grand Junction to communicate to core partners of a potential extreme precipitation event so they can take appropriate actions to prepare.

\section{Calculation of IVT}    %% Appendix A
\label{appendix:ivt}
Integrated water vapor transport (IVT), a variable widely used for the detection and identification of ARs (e.g., \citeA{Guan2015, MartinRalph2019}) is calculated by taking the 1-hourly model data, interpolating u and v wind components (m s\textsuperscript{-1}), and water vapor mixing ratio (kg kg\textsuperscript{-1}) to 20 pressure levels (1000, 975, 950, 925, 900, 875, 850, 825, 800, 775, 750, 700, 650, 600, 550, 500, 450, 400, 350, and 300 hPa). Only data at pressure levels above ground level were used for each grid cell in the integration. Then, using water vapor mixing ratio, we computed specific humidity (q) and then integrated u and v wind components with q at all pressure levels above ground level using the following equations:

\begin{equation}
IVT_{x} = -\frac{1}{g} \int_{1000}^{300} u q dp
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
IVT_{y} = -\frac{1}{g} \int_{1000}^{300} v q dp
\end{equation}

where g is the gravitational acceleration (m s\textsuperscript{-2}), u is zonal wind (m s\textsuperscript{-1}), v is meridional wind (m s\textsuperscript{-1}), q is specific humidity (kg kg\textsuperscript{-1}), p is pressure (Pa = kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-2}), and the column integration is between pressure levels 1000 and 250 hPa inclusive.

The magnitude of IVT is calculated using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
IVT = \sqrt{IVT_{x}^2 + IVT_{y}^2}
\end{equation}

Specific humidity (kg kg \textsuperscript{-1}) is derived from water vapor mixing ratio (kg kg \textsuperscript{-1}) using the formula from \cite{Wallace2006} where q is specific humidity and w is the water vapor mixing ratio.

\begin{equation}
q = \frac{w}{1 + w}
\end{equation}

% \section{Calculation of Water Vapor Flux}    %% Appendix B
% \label{appendix:wvf}
% Water vapor flux, a variable used in multiple AR-related studies to examine the vertical profile of water vapor (e.g., \citeA{Guan2015}), is the flux of water vapor at each identified pressure level. The following equations were used to calculate water vapor flux: 

% \begin{equation}
% VT_{u}^{p}   = q*u 
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
% VT_{v}^{p}   = q*v   
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
% VT = \sqrt{VT^{2}_{u} + VT^{2}_{v}}
% \end{equation}

% where q is specific humidity (kg kg\textsuperscript{-1}), u is zonal wind (m s\textsuperscript{-1}), v is meridional wind (m s\textsuperscript{-1}) at specified pressure, p. If specific humidity retains its kg kg\textsuperscript{-1}, the resulting units for water vapor flux are m s\textsuperscript{-1}.

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
