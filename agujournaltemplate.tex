\begin{abstract}
Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play a leading role in high-impact weather and long-term hydroclimate across the Western U.S., being both the primary drivers of flood damage and major contributors to water supply across much of this region. In response, the community has developed an extensive knowledge of AR frequency, intensity, impacts, key meteorological processes, and predictive skill, but this knowledge is primarily focused on ARs at or near landfall on the U.S. West Coast. Relatively little work has been done to understand AR characteristics further inland and this is especially true for Colorado, where high and complex topography, as well as distance from the coast, frustrate attempts to track ARs, AR-derived moisture, and AR-related impacts. While a large volume of anecdotal evidence suggests that ARs play a fundamental role in extreme precipitation and longer-term hydroclimate across Colorado, this relationship is yet to be systematically analyzed and quantified. This work uses novel methods to explore the role of ARs, their landfalling intensity, and their interannual variability on hydrometeorological extremes and impacts across the state, focusing on the relative contribution of inland-penetrating ARs to top-decile precipitation. 

We show that while the overhead AR frequency across Colorado is very low, moisture sourced from landfalling ARs affects this area much more frequently, penetrating inland along relatively low-elevation corridors through the Interior West. Consequently, AR contributions to precipitation across Colorado are higher than previous studies suggest, and exhibit substantial geographic and interannual variability. In addition, we highlight new forecast tools that enable better prediction of these events, developed in collaboration with National Weather Service offices across the state.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
% Main Idea: When you identify ARs over Colorado using traditional ARDTs and considering the days when an AR is directly overhead, you get very few ARs per year (less than 1 per year); therefore the goal of this paper is to objectively identify moisture from ARs that is penetrating inland, reaching Colorado, and triggering a precipitation response. *** Present this as an existing paradox that needs explanation ***
% Introduce: Can reference studies (Rutz et al., 2014; Guan and Waliser, 2015; Guan and Waliser, 2022  (AR Scale/ARDT)) that show the frequency of ARs overhead in Colorado as very few. 
% Key Point: Describe the use of trajectory analysis and it’s benefits in tracking air parcels associated with precipitation (Find some more studies, but can reference the Alexander et al., 2018 paper) 
% Explain Key Point: This point needs to be made now because it sets up why we did what we did for our methods
% Connect: This key point connects to the main point because we can now show that there are actually a much higher frequency of AR related moisture penetrating inland and triggering precipitation response. This has implications for weather forecasting (potential avenue to improve short term forecasting) as well as longer term hydroclimate implications (number of ARs per year influencing drought conditions)

% Motivation
% Quantify the precipitation contribution of AR moisture that reach CO
% Develop a methodology for attributing precipitation over the Western U.S. Interior to landfalling ARs along the U.S. West Coast and Gulf Coast and apply it to CO knowing that ARs break up and don’t meet traditional criteria by the time they reach CO

% Develop specialized AR-focused diagnostic and forecasting tools for the Colorado Front Range 
% Develop a tool and show it in use - for a single event




\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
\subsection{Colorado Watershed Boundaries}
To determine the contribution of AR related moisture to extreme precipitation days in Colorado, we use the Watershed Boundary Dataset created by the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of Agriculture - Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The polygon-based dataset represents the hydrologic unit (HU) boundaries to the 8-digit (HUC8) and identifies 92 HUC8 subbasins (hereafter referred to as subbasins) that touch Colorado. Additionally, we show analysis at the region level, which indicates that results for all subbasins (of the 92 analyzed) that share the first two digits of their HU code. For example, we summarize results for Colorado subbasins that fall within the Rio Grande Region (HUC2 13), which shows the results for the xx subbasins whose first two digits of the HUC8 of are 13 (Colorado Region HUC2 is 14, South Platte Region HUC2 is 10, and Arkansas Region HUC2 is 11).

\subsection{Reanalysis Data}

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalyses of the global climate (ERA5) at 1-h and  0.25\textdegree{} resolutions were used to examine geopotential height, winds, specific humidity at multiple pressure levels, as well as IVT \cite{Hersbach2020}. Zonal and meridional IVT were calculated by taking the 1-hourly reanalyses, interpolating u and v wind components (m s\textsuperscript{-1}), and water vapor mixing ratio (kg kg\textsuperscript{-1}) between 300 hPa and the surface (see Appendix \ref{appendix:ivt} for equations). The vertical fluxes of water vapor were calculated by multiplying the v (meridional) or u (zonal) component wind by specific humidity (q) at each pressure level (see Appendix \ref{appendix:wvf} for equations).

\subsection{Precipitation Data}

For precipitation, we generated daily time series for each subbasin based on daily total precipitation (rain and melted snow) provided by the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). The daily total precipitation is area aggregated to the HUC8 subbasins from 1 Jan 2000 to 31 Dec 2023 where the 24-hour precipitation ends at 12 UTC of each day. Mean areal precipitation is calculated by identifying the latitude and longitude pairs on a 0.05\textdegree{} grid that fall in each subbasin and using bilinear interpolation to interpolate the PRISM 4-km grid to those points within the subbasin. The point values are then averaged within each subbasin, giving mean areal precipitation in mm per day. 

%% which PRISM dataset did Jay download? https://prism.oregonstate.edu/documents/PRISM_datasets.pdf

We used the distribution of precipitation values for each subbasin to determine the 90th percentile threshold, only considering days when precipitation is greater than 2.54 mm (0.1 inch). We ran trajectories for all days in each subbasin where precipitation exceeded 90th percentile, hereafter referred to as top-decile precipitation days.


\subsection{AR Detection}

Three commonly used AR detection tools (ARDTs) were employed to detect ARs: (1) the Tracking Atmospheric Rivers Globally as Elongated Targets (tARget) algorithm version 4 was applied to global, 1-h, 0.25\textdegree{} horizontal resolution ERA5 from 1940 to 2023 \cite{Guan2024AERA5}. The tARget v4 uses a combination of geometry (e.g., length, width), relative IVT intensity thresholds (e.g., above 85th percentile of local climatological IVT), and directional components (e.g., must be poleward) to detect AR objects. Additionally, tARget v4 is a combination of condition (meeting the threshold and geometry requirements) and tracking (AR object is followed across time and space) computation type. (2) the \citeA{Rutz2014} method was applied to global, 3-h, 0.5\textdegree{}x0.625\textdegree{} horizontal resolution Modern Era Retrospective Reanalysis Version 2 (MERRA2) from 1980 to 2023 (hereafter referred to as the Rutz ARDT) \cite{Bosilovich2015, Gelaro2017}. The Rutz ARDT uses a combination of geometry and absolute IVT intensity thresholds (e.g. greater than or equal to 250 kg m-1 s-1). (3) the AR Scale \cite{MartinRalph2019} was applied to global, 1-h, 0.25\textdegree{} horizontal resolution ERA5 from 2000 to 2023. The AR Scale identifies ARs using a point-based value of 1--5 based on the maximum IVT magnitude and the duration of IVT $>$ 250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1} at that point \cite{MartinRalph2019}. Points must sustain IVT $>$ 250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1} for at least 24 hours to be considered an AR Scale 1. 

Figure \ref{fig:ar_overhead} shows the frequency of overhead AR conditions in Colorado using the above-mentioned ARDTs. \citeA{Guan2024AERA5} tARgetv4 has the highest frequency at about 4--7\% of the time, which aligns well with relative threshold ARDTs being considered more permissive \cite{Rutz2019ARTMIP}. The AR Scale and Rutz ARDT show similar AR frequencies at about 0--4\% of the time, with the highest frequency occurring in the southeastern region of the state. AR Scale 1 and AR Scale 2 are the highest frequency (not shown), with AR Scale 4 and 5 rarely, if ever, occurring.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}
\subsection{Backwards Trajectory Analysis}

To run the backwards trajectories, we use the simple lagrangian analysis employed in \citeA{Rutz2015} where the zonal, meridional, and vertical wind components from ERA5 data are trilinearly interpolated to determine the atmospheric data at each trajectory location for 72 hours at 1-h resolution. The ~27-km horizontal resolution and 1-hr temporal resolution in ERA5 provides a reasonable estimate for the interpolated atmospheric data at each subsequent trajectory location.

We completed sensitivity tests on the grid points, height, and time of initialization conditions for four individual subbasins within each of the basins for four separate, top-decile precipitation days. Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_tests} shows the results of the varying initialization sensitivity tests for the 17--19 March 2003 storm that produced historical snowfall and significant impacts across Colorado \cite{Wesley2013Extreme2003}. \textbf{Grid Points:} The sensitivity test trajectories were initiated from the latitude and longitude of the centroid of the subbasin, plus at four points (N, S, E, W) that were 0.25 \textdegree{} from the centroid (e.g. if the centroid of the subbasin was 107\textdegree W, 38\textdegree N, the additional initialization points were 107\textdegree W, 38.25\textdegree N, 107\textdegree W, 37.75\textdegree N, 106.75\textdegree W, 38\textdegree N, and 107.25\textdegree W, 38\textdegree N). There were few differences in the trajectories initialized from the different grid points; there were a few exceptions in the trajectories initialized from 600 hPa in the Arkansas Headwaters (southeastern CO) (Fig. \ref{fig:sensitivity_tests}e, g, and h) where some of the trajectories were sourced from more northerly flow while others followed a more southerly anticyclonic rotation. Likely these differences arose from differences in surface pressure from the different points, therefore, we chose to run all the trajectories from the centroid of each subbasin.

\textbf{Height:} In the vertical, we examined trajectories initiated on pressure levels from 500 hPa to 800 hPa at 100-hPa increments (e.g., 500, 600, 700, 800) (Fig. S1). The different initialization heights resulted in very different trajectory paths, as the parcel followed the synoptic patterns typical for that height. For example, the trajectories initialized from 500 hPa (Fig. \ref{fig:sensitivity_tests}a--d) exhibit more westerly flow, aligning with typical midlatitude 500 hPa wind patterns. On the other hand, below 700 hPa, 95\% of the trajectories come from the north, likely the barrier jet-like feature identified in \citeA{Wesley2013Extreme2003}. Due to the complex topography of Colorado and the varying results from the different initialization heights, we chose to initialize each trajectory at the single pressure level between 50 and 100 hPa above (at a lower pressure than) the surface. For example, at the grid point closest to the centroid of the Upper Yampa subbasin, the surface pressure was 827 hPa, so the trajectory for that subbasin was initialized from 750 hPa. Meanwhile, at the grid point closest to the centroid of the South Platte subbasin, the surface pressure was 967, so the trajectory for that subbasin was initialized from 850 hPa. This methodology, similarly employed by \citeA{Alexander2015}, initializes trajectories high enough so that the majority of the trajectories remained above the surface over North America, but was low enough to be located within the region of strong water vapor transport (i.e., between 1000 and 300 hPa). 

\textbf{Time:} Since the PRISM daily precipitation data is centered on 00 UTC of each day, the sensitivity test trajectories were initialized at 12 and 18 UTC of the previous day, plus 00, and 06 UTC of the day when precipitation exceeded the 90th percentile. There were few differences in trajectories initialized at different times in the 24-hour period of precipitation accumulation; therefore, we chose to initialize all of our trajectories from 00 UTC to center them in the middle of the 24-hour precipitation accumulation period.

\end{figure}

\subsection{AR Conditions at the Coast}

To determine whether any given top-decile precipitation day was associated with an AR we evaluated the AR conditions when the trajectory crossed the coast across North America. For the coastal grid cells, we used < ask Bin how he generated the coastal grids in tARget v4>. We tested multiple ARDTs including the AR Scale using ERA5 data \cite{MartinRalph2019}, the \citeA{Rutz2014} ARDT, and the \cite{Guan2024AERA5} tARget v4 ARDT. Between the different ARDTs there was XX difference. Overall, there was little variation in the final results. We share the results using the ERA5 AR Scale for this paper, though Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth} shows the differences in the ARDTs for the contribution of ARs to top-decile precipitation. 

We also tested multiple spatio-temporal criteria for determining whether a trajectory was associated with an AR at the coast. For example, we utilized “strict” requirements for associating a trajectory at the coast with an AR. The strict method said if a trajectory crossed the coast, the AR had to be present at the hour the trajectory crossed the coast as well as at the same grid cell. With the strict methodology, we saw only about xx ARs associated with the Upper Yampa subbasin per year. On the other hand, we used “flexible” criteria to determine whether any given trajectory was associated with an AR. The flexible criteria said that if there was an AR within any grid cell within 1 degree (+- 0.5 degree from the grid where the trajectory crossed the coast) and within 24 hours (+- 12 hours from when the trajectory crossed the coast). The flexible requirements saw about 20 ARs associated with the Upper Yampa subbasin per year. In the end, we chose to utilize the flexible requirements for this analysis. This is because the trajectories themselves are fairly ephemeral and are tracking one specific air parcel in space in time that we assume is associated with the precipitation in that subbasin. Based on our sensitivity tests on initialization conditions, you can see that even with minor changes in initialization conditions can result in a different end point for the trajectory. Therefore, using the flexible requirements for determining whether that top-decile precipitation day is associated with a coastal landfalling AR is better for capturing the possibility that even though that exact air parcel does not have an AR directly overhead at the coast, it is likely that the moisture from the AR was able to penetrate inland and reach Colorado and result in precipitation.

\subsection{Contribution of AR moisture to Top-Decile Precipitation events across Colorado}
\label{sec:results:contribution}
% Main Idea: This section will describe the contribution (average and interannual variation) of AR moisture to top-decile precipitation events across Colorado
% Introduce: Using the above-defined methodology for backwards trajectory analysis and determining if each trajectory was associated with an AR when it crossed the coast or not, Figure 3 shows the fraction of top-decile precipitation associated with landfalling AR moisture. 
% Key Point: Describe the results of the various ARDTs
% Explain Key Point: This point needs to be made to show that even with varying ARDTs, the results are consistent. Then describe the patterns of fraction of contribution with an emphasis on NW, SW, NE, SE Colorado
% Connect: This map directly represents the total top-decile precipitation contribution by moisture associated with ARs between 2000 and 2023 for each subbasin. 
% Next Key Point: Compare the results to those found in Rutz et al. 2015
% Explain Key Point: The results we have show a higher fraction of contribution - this aligns with anecdotal evidence from NWS and shows that this is a useful methodology for identifying AR moisture penetrating inland in locations that do not see as much AR activity. Additionally, add a sentence or two about the SNOTEL station result in the San Juans in Rutz et al. 2015 and how that aligns very well with what our results show.
% Connect: This shows that our methodology is an improvement, but also still aligns well with previous research - this methodology could be used elsewhere and is needed in CO.
% Next Key Point: Describe the number of trajectories associated with a landfalling atmospheric river (Figure 4)
% Explain Key Point: This result shows the paths and AR scale value associated with the trajectories that did cross the coast broken down by season - this gives us a general number per year of top-decile precipitation days associated with atmospheric river moisture and starts to give us an idea of the paths moisture takes for the different basins across Colorado
% Connect: This shows when AR associated moisture is more frequent for each basin in Colorado as well as starts to show the paths that they take (i.e., winter westerly trajectories more common for western CO while summer southeasterly trajectories are more common for eastern CO)

For all top-decile precipitation days in each of the 92 subbasins in Colorado, we applied the backwards trajectory analysis as outlined in Section \ref{sec:methods} and then determined AR conditions at the coast using three different ARDTs: tARgetv4, Rutz ARDT, and ERA5 AR Scale \cite{MartinRalph2019, Rutz2014, Guan2024AERA5}. Figure \ref{fig:choropleth} shows the fraction of top-decile precipitation associated with coastal landfalling ARs for each of the different ARDTs and their coefficient of variation for contributions from water year to water year. 

%% sentences about the higher fraction located in western CO
In western Colorado, in the Colorado and Rio Grande Regions, moisture from coastal landfalling ARs is associated with 10--70\% top-decile precipitation, with the highest fraction of top-decile precipitation associated with ARs occurring in subbasins in southwestern Colorado (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}a--c). The subbasins with the highest contribution are Animas subbasin with 69.4\%, Conejos subbasin with 60.3\%, and Upper Dolores subbasin with 59.5\%. In the Rio Grande Headwaters, the contribution is 65.4\%, a much higher fraction than the 0--30\% of contribution that \citeA[Fig. 11b]{Rutz2014} found in southwestern Colorado. The differences between these results is likely because \citeA{Rutz2014} calculates the fraction of top-decile precipitation associated with ARs directly overhead using the Rutz ARDT, which has geometry requirements and an absolute IVT threshold of 250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}. IVT in western Colorado averages around 100 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1} and peaks around 500 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}, therefore, it would be rare for IVT to exceed 250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}, let alone an AR maintain its shape long enough across western Colorado to meet the geometry requirements. In \citeA[Fig. 3]{Rutz2015}, they run forward trajectory analysis from the U.S. West Coast on AR landfall days and found that less than 130 trajectories classified as coastal-decaying ARs were able to reach Colorado, while fewer than 50 interior-penetrating AR trajectories reached Colorado.

In the Rio Grande Headwaters, there was very little variability in the fraction of top-decile AR precipitation between the tARgetv4 and AR Scale ARDTs where the fraction was about 63\% and 65\%, respectively, while the fraction for the Rutz ARDT was much lower at 47\% (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}a--c). Perhaps the reason for the larger variability between the ARDTs for this area is xxx. The water year coefficient of variability ranged from 0.3 (based on AR Scale ARDT, Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}e) to 0.4 (based on Rutz ARDT, Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}f) in the Rio Grande subbasin.

In northwestern Colorado, AR moisture is associated with 20--50\% of the total top-decile precipitation, with about 35\% in the Upper Yampa subbasin (white outline in northwest CO). There is little variation between the different ARDTs and the fraction of AR-associated top-decile precipitation. In the Upper Yampa subbasin, the tARgetv4 and Rutz ARDTs found the lower fraction of top-decile AR precipitation at 25\% and 27\%, respectively (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}a, c), while the AR Scale ARDT fraction was higher at 35\% (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}b). For year to year variability, the coefficient of variability ranged from 0.3 (based on AR Scale ARDT, Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}e) to 0.4 (based on tARgetv4 ARDT, Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}d) in the Upper Yampa subbasin. Similar variability in the fraction of top-decile precipitation from water year to water year in the Upper Yampa and Rio Grande subbasins is likely due to x. 

Contributions are lower in eastern Colorado, ranging from 0--40\%. In northeastern Colorado, in the Upper South Platte subbasin, contributions from ARs to top-decile precipitation are less than 5\%, but there is some variability between ARDTs (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}a--c). The Rutz ARDT identified the lowest fraction at 0.6\% (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}c), tARget at 2.5\% (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}a), and the AR Scale at 4\% (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}b). However, there is very little water year variability in the Upper South Platte, with coefficients from the different ARDTs ranging from 0--0.2 (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}d--f). This is likely because there are very few trajectories that are associated with ARs in this region in the first place. 

Southeastern Colorado sees a higher contribution over a larger area than northeastern Colorado, with 10--40\% of top-decile precipitation associated with coastal AR moisture (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}a--c). There was very little variability between ARDTs in the fraction of top-decile AR precipitation in the Arkansas Headwaters subbasin, where the tARgetv4 and Rutz ARDTs found a slightly lower fraction of top-decile AR precipitation at 8.5\% and 8\%, respectively (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}a, c), compared to the AR Scale ARDT fraction at 9.5\% (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}b). Most of the variability between the ARDTs occurs in the most southeasterly subbasins in Colorado, with tARgetv4 identifying a lower contribution than Rutz ARDT and the AR Scale (Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}d--f).

This is likely because the main difference between the ARDTs is that tARgetv4 uses a relative, percentile-based threshold for determining the minimum IVT value to be considered part of an AR and Rutz ARDT and ERA5 use an absolute threshold of 250 kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-1}. Since a large fraction of the trajectories in southeastern Colorado sourced moisture from the Gulf of Mexico (see Section \ref{sec:results:moisture_pathways} for more discussion on the moisture pathways), a relative threshold like the one used in tARgetv4 is likely to detect fewer ARs, while an absolute threshold will detect more ARs because IVT values are climatologically a lot higher. In northeastern Colorado, only two subbasins located in the far northeastern region of the state see contributions higher than 10\%. 

Water year variability coefficients are some of the highest in the Arkansas Headwaters subbasin, ranging from 0.5 (tARgetv4 and AR Scale, Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}d, e) to 0.6 (Rutz ARDT, Fig. \ref{fig:choropleth}f). This is likely because extreme precipitation in the Arkansas River basin falls primarily during convective storms in warm season months, and has high spatial heterogeneity due to complex terrain \cite{Javier2007ClimatologyBasin}.

Figure \ref{fig:time_series} shows the top-decile precipitation within each water year (WY) for the Upper Yampa, Rio Grande Headwaters, Upper South Platte, and the Arkansas Headwaters subbasins and compares them to the contribution associated with coastal ARs. Notably, the fraction of top-decile precipitation is higher in the Upper Yampa (10--54\%) and Rio Grande Headwaters (31--100\%) subbasins compared to the Upper South Platte (14--20\%) and Arkansas Headwaters (11-25\%) subbasins. Additionally, there are more years in the eastern subbasins where there is a 0\% contribution from coastal ARs to top-decile precipitation, whereas in the Upper Yampa there are 3 years with a 0\% contribution and no years in the Rio Grande Headwaters subbasin. The average amount of top-decile precipitation associated with coastal ARs ranges from just below ~25 mm per year in the Upper Yampa, Upper South Platte, and Arkansas Headwaters subbasin to ~90 mm per year in the Rio Grande Headwaters subbasin. From year to year, there is high variability in top-decile precipitation across all the subbasins. For example, in the Rio Grande Headwaters, the years 2002 and 2018 saw only ~30 mm of top-decile precipitation, while 2001 and 2008 saw 195 mm and 267 mm, respectively.

\subsection{Moisture Pathways for Inland Penetrating ARs}
\label{sec:results:moisture_pathways}
% Main Idea: The main idea for this section is to show the common pathways for moisture to be able to penetrate inland and make it to CO. What are the common paths? What does the vertical structure of the moisture flux look like when it crosses complex topographic areas of interest?
% Introduce: Understanding the moisture paths of the inland penetrating moisture will help us understand the paths more likely to be taken - when forecasts show that ARs are likely to take these paths, we will have a better idea of upcoming precipitation patterns. 
% Key Point: Describe the pathways of moisture using Figure 5 for the different basins and the average IVT as each trajectory passes through (Figure 6).
% Explain Key Point: This will have discussions on the higher frequency of the moisture paths for each basin and what season/time of year is more likely for these paths.
% Connect: We can show that the pathways are very similar to those outlined in Rutz et al., 2015 - however the trajectories from that work did not quite extend to Colorado - this work is confirming the pathways and the relationship to top-decile precipitation.
% Next Key Point: Now that we have the horizontal pathways described, we now will show the vertical pathway composites over a few topographic areas of interest (e.g., where the horizontal pathways are common and there are topographic barriers) (Figure 7)
% Explain Key Point: The vertical pathway composites will show the frequency of the trajectories in the vertical along different topographic barriers of interest. This will give us a better understanding of how the moisture is able to continue penetrating inland - is it along a valley? Is the moisture much higher at a certain point because it has been lifted?
% Connect: This section will give us a better understanding of the vertical structure of the moisture as it penetrates inland.

\section{Calculation of IVT}    %% Appendix A
\label{appendix:ivt}
Integrated water vapor transport (IVT), a variable widely used for the detection and identification of ARs (e.g., \citeA{Guan2015, MartinRalph2019}) is calculated by taking the 3-hourly model data, interpolating u and v wind components (m s\textsuperscript{-1}), and water vapor mixing ratio (kg kg\textsuperscript{-1}) to 20 pressure levels (1000, 975, 950, 925, 900, 875, 850, 825, 800, 775, 750, 700, 650, 600, 550, 500, 450, 400, 350, and 300 hPa). Only data at pressure levels above ground level were used for each grid cell in the integration. Then, using water vapor mixing ratio, we computed specific humidity (q) and then integrated u and v wind components with q at all pressure levels above ground level using the following equations:

\begin{equation}
IVT_{x} = -\frac{1}{g} \int_{1000}^{300} u q dp
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
IVT_{y} = -\frac{1}{g} \int_{1000}^{300} v q dp
\end{equation}

where g is the gravitational acceleration (m s\textsuperscript{-2}), u is zonal wind (m s\textsuperscript{-1}), v is meridional wind (m s\textsuperscript{-1}), q is specific humidity (kg kg\textsuperscript{-1}), p is pressure (Pa = kg m\textsuperscript{-1} s\textsuperscript{-2}), and the column integration is between pressure levels 1000 and 250 hPa inclusive.

The magnitude of IVT is calculated using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
IVT = \sqrt{IVT_{x}^2 + IVT_{y}^2}
\end{equation}

Specific humidity (kg kg \textsuperscript{-1}) is derived from water vapor mixing ratio (kg kg \textsuperscript{-1}) using the formula from \cite{Wallace2006} where q is specific humidity and w is the water vapor mixing ratio.

\begin{equation}
q = \frac{w}{1 + w}
\end{equation}

\section{Calculation of Water Vapor Flux}    %% Appendix B
\label{appendix:wvf}
Water vapor flux, a variable used in multiple AR-related studies to examine the vertical profile of water vapor (e.g., \citeA{Guan2015}), is the flux of water vapor at each identified pressure level. The following equations were used to calculate water vapor flux: 

\begin{equation}
VT_{u}^{p}   = q*u 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
VT_{v}^{p}   = q*v   
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
VT = \sqrt{VT^{2}_{u} + VT^{2}_{v}}
\end{equation}

where q is specific humidity (kg kg\textsuperscript{-1}), u is zonal wind (m s\textsuperscript{-1}), v is meridional wind (m s\textsuperscript{-1}) at specified pressure, p. If specific humidity retains its kg kg\textsuperscript{-1}, the resulting units for water vapor flux are m s\textsuperscript{-1}.
